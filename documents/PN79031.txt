<TITLE>Results of 10 years of screening of newborn infants for inherited metabolic diseases in the province of Limburg (Belgium).</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In the province of Limburg, all newborn babies are screened for metabolic anomalies: for amino acidopathies since 1968, for galactosemia since 1974 and for mucoviscidosis since 1978. On 127,676 newborns, there were 12 cases of phenylketonuria and 3 other inherited anomalies. A meaningful policy of the government on neonatal screening necessarily requires a good organization, to put together the screening data, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up.</ABSTRACT>
