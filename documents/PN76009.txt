<TITLE>Clinical observations on the biliary system in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The biliary tree of 66 patients with cystic fibrosis was examined by conventional roentgenographic methods. Forty-five per cent of the oral cholecystograms were judged abnormal by our criteria. A study was considered abnormal if there was no visualization or if there was visualization of a microgallbladder or structural abnormality including marginal irregularities, septate gallbladder or cholelithiasis. Intravenous cholangiography was used to further study the 22 patients who did not visualize on the oral study. Again, anatomic abnormalities were prevalent but six patients in this group had normal appearing gallbladders. Abdominal pain, a frequent symptom in cystic fibrosis, was not associated with roentgenographic abnormality. No correlation was seen between the external biliary tree abnormalities and multifocal biliary cirrhosis which was present in 40% of these patients. Further, no correlation was seen between serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels and either of these lesions.</ABSTRACT>
