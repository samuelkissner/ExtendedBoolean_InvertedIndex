<TITLE>The patterns of infection in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Thirty-five patients with cystic fibrosis (aged 11 months to 13.5 years) have been investigated with regard to respiratory symptoms, respiratory tract pathogens, serum immunoglobulins and serum precipitins. Haemophilus influenzae was the commonest pathogen being supplanted in advanced disease by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patients who had no respiratory infection had levels of IgG significantly lower than normal children of comparable ages. In children with severe respiratory infection the immunoglobulins were raised and precipitins to the predominant respiratory organism were present. These findings differ from the prevalent view that patients with cystic fibrosis have a normal response to infection and that the common infecting organism is Staphylococcus aureus.</ABSTRACT>
