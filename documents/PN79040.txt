<TITLE>Vocational development and adjustment of adolescents with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Adolescents with cystic fibrosis were compared with normal adolescents of the same age and educational grade on several measures of vocational development and adjustment. The cystic fibrosis group in ages 12--16 and in grades 7, 8, and 9 scored lower than their normal counterparts in measures of vocational and educational plans, and were less realistic than normals in considering their limitations and financial constraints. In contrast, the cystic fibrosis group at nearly all age and grade levels scored significantly higher on strength of commitment to vocational choice, work values, and awareness of occupational information. Compared to 4 additional handicapped groups already studied, adolescents with cystic fibrosis scored favorably. They not only plan to work but also hold strong work values compared to normals. Rehabilitation programs should emphasize preparation for a career and the development of educational and vocational plans while the adolescent is still in high school.</ABSTRACT>
