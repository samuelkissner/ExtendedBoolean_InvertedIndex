<TITLE>Pleiotropic drug resistance in cystic fibrosis fibroblasts: increased resistance to cyclic AMP.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In previous studies, cystic fibrosis (CF) fibroblasts were demonstrated to be resistant to the cytotoxic effects of ouabain, dexamethasone, and the sex hormones, dihydrotestosterone, 17beta- estradiol, and progesterone. We now show that CF fibroblasts also exhibit greatly increased resistance to the cytotoxic effects of exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP), as well as to isoproterenol and theophylline, drugs which are known to increase endogenous levels of cAMP. CF cells were also shown to have normal amounts of (3H)cAMP binding to protein kinase as well as normal amounts of cAMP- stimulated protein kinase activity. Phosphodiesterase in CF cells was also found to be stimulated by cAMP to the same degree as in normal cells. These findings suggest that there is no detectable protein kinase deficiency in CF cells. cf cells thus appear to be unlike some cAMP-resistant mutants described by others which are defective in protein kinase activity and cAMP regulation of phosphodiesterase levels. The cross-resistance of CF fibroblasts to ouabain, steroid hormones, and cAMP may provide a unique opportunity to study the biochemical events involved in the metabolism of these drugs as well as the basic biochemical defect in a common human genetic disease.</ABSTRACT>
