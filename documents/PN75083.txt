<TITLE>Demonstration of a factor in the serum of homozygotes and heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis by a non-biological technique.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A factor has been isolated from serum of homozygotes and obligate heterozygotes for cystic fibrosis using isoelectric focusing and disc electrophoresis as analytical methods. The factor is focused within an IgG-fraction with an isoelectric point of pH 8 to 9 but differs from IgG in its lower molecular weight. It is thus similar to, if not identical with, the ciliary dyskinesia factor.</ABSTRACT>
