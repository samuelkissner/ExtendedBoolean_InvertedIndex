<TITLE>Management of meconium ileus by resection and end-to-end anastomosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Six patients with meconium ileus, in whom bowel resection and end-to- end anastomosis were performed, are presented. Meconium ileus may be simple or complicated. The simple form may be treated by Gastrografin enema. Surgery is indicated if conservative treatment fails and for patients with a complicated obstruction. Provided the bowel is disobstructed and carefully resected, end-to-end anastomosis is preferable. Confirmation of the diagnosis by careful histological examination of the resected bowel is urged.</ABSTRACT>
