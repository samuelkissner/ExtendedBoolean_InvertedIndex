<TITLE>Serotyping of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Serotyping of 30 mucoid strains isolated from cystic fibrosis patients was carried out by slide agglutination tests with both live and heat-killed cells and by tube agglutination test with heat-killed cells. Comparison of the results obtained by these 2 methods revealed that tube agglutination with heat-killed cells was the superior method. More than half the strains were found to be Homma's serotype 15 (group M in the new schema [2]). Slide agglutination with live cells did not give clear results: some strains showed occasionally positive or negative agglutinations against the same serotype serum. Changes in serotypes (groups in the new schema [2]) were found in some strains, although the number was very small.</ABSTRACT>
