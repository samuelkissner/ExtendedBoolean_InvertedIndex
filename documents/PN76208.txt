<TITLE>L-fucose metabolism in cystic fibrosis fibroblasts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The capacity of skin fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF individuals to incorporate exogenous L-fucose into various metabolic pools was compared. Incorporation into intracellular acid-soluble pools and extracellular glycopeptides was measured by a dual-label co- chromatographic technique, whereas total macromolecular incorporation was measured by a single-label procedure. Although CF and normal fibroblasts incorporate exogenous fucose into intracellular acid- soluble and high molecular weight compounds in a similar manner, CF cells appear to be characterized by an increased incorporation of label into low molecular weight extracellular glycopeptides.</ABSTRACT>
