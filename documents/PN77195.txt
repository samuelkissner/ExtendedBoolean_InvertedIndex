<TITLE>Cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is a serious genetic disorder occurring mainly among the Whites and starting in early childhood or even at birth. The name is a shortening of the old term Cystic Fibrosis (or Fibrocystic disease) of the pancreas. This comes from the historical appearance at post-mortem first described by Landsteiner in 1905. It was only in 1938 that Dorothee Anderson and Fanconi realised that the disease was a separate entity and not simply a manifestation of other illnesses. Another name is Mucoviscidosis which gives a clue as to one of the most important features of the disease. Mucus formed is thicker and stickier (more viscid) than normal and tends to clog up the bronchi and ducts, particularly the pancreatic ducts. Chronic bronchitis with recurrent severe infection and malabsorption are the main symptoms of the disease. The other important abnormality is an increased amount of sodium chloride (salt) in the sweat. This fact, used in the diagnosis, was first realised during a heat wave in New York in 1953 when it was noticed that most of the children with heat prostration suffered from C.F. Little is known of the causes of the abnormalities of sweat and mucus. Some generalised cell abnormality (? enzymatic) seems possible. There is no doubt that the condition is genetically transmitted and most evidence favours a recessive mode of inheritance.</ABSTRACT>
