<TITLE>Deficiency of serum carboxypeptidase B-like (anaphylatoxin inactivator, carboxypeptidase N) activity in sera from patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Serum from 95 patients with cystic fibrosis and 47 control subjects without cystic fibrosis was analyzed for carboxypeptidase B-like activity in the presence of optimal concentrations of Co2+ ion, hippuryl-L-lysine and serum. Fourteen of the cystic fibrosis patients had no steatorrhea and therefore minimal pancreatic dysfunction. Patients with cystic fibrosis and controls were of comparable age. Serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity was significantly decreased in cystic fibrosis patients including cystic fibrosis patients without steatorrhea. Significantly low values were found in both male and female cystic fibrosis patients when compared with controls of similar sex. Although values were unaffected by age in the control population, values in older patients with cystic fibrosis were significantly lower than values in younger patients. No correlation was obtained between serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity and pulmonary or hepatic function. Serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity therefore falls with progression of the disease and may limit the ability to degrade circulating peptides in older patients with cystic fibrosis. Deficient serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity is less likely, however, to be a factor in the development of the early manifestations of the disease.</ABSTRACT>
