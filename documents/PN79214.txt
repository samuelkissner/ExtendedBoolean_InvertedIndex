<TITLE>Genetic aspects of pediatric lung disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Several genetic diseases are described which affect the lung, usually or at least in some cases, in the pediatric age group. The four disorders discussed have been selected wither for their high frequency or for their demonstration of the variety of ways in which genetic factors can influence disease: cystic fibrosis, one of the most common of the metabolic disorders inherited as an autosomal recessive trait; immotile cilia syndrome, including Kartagener's syndrome, single gene disorders involving structural abnormalities of the cilia; asthma, a common disorder in children with a genetic component; and alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, an inherited protein deficiency commonly causing obstructive lung disease in adults and occasionally affecting children.</ABSTRACT>
