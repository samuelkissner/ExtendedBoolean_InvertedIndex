<TITLE>Alpha-1-antitrypsin in duodenal fluid and gallbladder bile.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Using the immunoelectrophoretic method alpha-1-antitrypsin was detected in all but 6 of 26 samples of duodenal fluid obtained from 16 patients with various gastroenterological problems. The concentrations (mg/100 ml) of alpha-1-antitrypsin in duodenal aspirates from children with liver disease (7.32 plus or minus 6.1) were less than those from children with cystic fibrosis, Shwachman Diamond syndrome, or Hirschsprung's disease (16.7 plus or minus 11.9; p smaller than 0.02). Alpha-1-antitrypsin was detected in all but one of 6 samples of gallbladder bile, the exception being that from a patient with extrahepatic biliary atresia. No significant correlation was found between the alpha-1-antitrypsin concentration in the samples studied and the corresponding total antitrypsin activity.</ABSTRACT>
