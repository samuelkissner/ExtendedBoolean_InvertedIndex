<TITLE>Plasma tocopherol in infants and children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A study has been made of plasma tocopherol concentrations in normal children and in children with intestinal abnormalities. A positive correlation between plasma tocopherol and age is shown between the ages of 4 months and 10 years. Most patients with cystic fibrosis or coeliac disease were found to have markedly reduced plasma tocopherol concentrations in comparison with the normal children of similar age.</ABSTRACT>
