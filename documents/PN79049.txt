<TITLE>Induction of alkaline phosphatase in cultured human fibroblasts. Comparison of normal cells and those from patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The membrane glycoprotein enzyme, alkaline phosphatase was induced in cultured human fibroblasts by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, sodium butyrate, the serum glycoprotein fetuin, the Tamm-Horsfall urinary glycoprotein, and by a number of inhibitors of DNA synthesis. The uninduced basal enzyme activity increased at later stages of growth when the cells became confluent. Induction by dibutyryl cyclic AMP or fetuin was most effective when the agents were added after the cells had reached stationary phase and was maximal after at least two days of exposure. The levels of induction resulting from the addition of pairs of the agents, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, n-butyrate and fetuin were additive indicating that these have different modes of action. The inhibitors of DNA synthesis, cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea, and methothrexate were less effective inducers. Bromodeoxyuridine which also has non-DNA mediated effects induced to the same extent as dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Similar experiments with sex- and age-matched cell strains derived from patients with cystic fibrosis failed to detect differences in the levels of induction from those observed in normal cells. In addition, the combined inductive effects of Tamm- Horsfall glycoprotein, isoproterenol and theophylline, were similar with normal and cystic fibrosis cells.</ABSTRACT>
