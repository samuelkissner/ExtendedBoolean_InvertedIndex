<TITLE>Infarction of the common bile duct in an infant after surfical exploration for jaundice: a possible cause of extrahepatic biliary atresia.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>An infant explored for obstructive jaundice died 6 days postoperatively and was found to have extensive infarction of the common duct. This would have gone undetected had the patient survived and without careful sampling at autopsy. The incidence of this unsuspected complication is unknown. Surgical infarction may be one cause of fibrosis and secondary atresia of the extra-hepatic bile ducts.</ABSTRACT>
