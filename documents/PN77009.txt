<TITLE>Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis. Relative prevalence of antibodies in serum against cathodic and anodic migrating P. aeruginosa antigens determined by immunoelectrophoretic methods.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Sera from 119 patients with cystic fibrosis were examined for precipitating antibodies against anodic migrating P. aeruginosa antigens by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The presence of precipitins against cathodic migrating P. aeruginosa antigens was investigated by means of classical immunoelectrophoresis. Thirty-six per cent of the sera contained precipitins against both anodic and cathodic antigens, 20% contained only precipitins against anodic antigens, none contained only precipitins against cathodic antigens, and 44% had no demonstrable P. aeurginosa precipitins. The amount of extra information obtained by combining the results of classical immunoelectrophoresis with the results of crossed immunoelectrophoresis was small.</ABSTRACT>
