<TITLE>Medical mucoid lesions of the pulmonary artery in cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and other disorders.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Alterations in the pulmonary vascular bed were reviewed in the autopsy material from 35 patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and cor pulmonale. Hypertrophy of the media or intimal proliferation of small muscular arteries and arterioles was noted in eight patients; intimal proliferation of the larger caliber arteries was seen in seven patients. The unexpected change, however, was the presence of interstitial hyaline material in the media of the pulmonary artery or its major branches in one-third of the specimens. The elastic fibers were distorted, but not disrupted, and the finding was unrelated to the presence or severity of other vascular changes. Intimal deposits of the same material were also present in seven of the patients with intimal proliferation in major pulmonary arteries. Identical medial lesions were found in the pulmonary arteries of seven of 35 children with pulmonary hypertension and in seven patients with other disorders. Similar lesions in the media of the aorta were found in each group of patients. The material was not Schiff-reactive, but had the histochemical characteristics of a connective tissue acid mucopolysaccharide.</ABSTRACT>
