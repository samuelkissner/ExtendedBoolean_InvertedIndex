<TITLE>Tobramycin therapy of pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Six patients having exacerbations of chronic pulmonary infections in association with cystic fibrosis were treated with intramuscular tobramycin 5 mg./kg./day in 3 divided doses. The eight treatment courses lasted 9 to 30 days. Mean serum levels were 2.5 microg./ml. at 1 to 3 hours and 0.2 microg./ml. at 7 1/2 to 8 hours after a dose of tobramycin. The mean tobramycin concentration in sputum was 0.3 microg./ml. Eighty-two percent of the 66 pathogenic bacterial isolates from sputum were either Pseudomonas sp. (64%) or Staphylococcus aureus (18%). Ninety-seven percent of Pseudomonas sp. and 83 percent of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1 microg. tobramycin per ml. No organism that was isolated before therapy was observed to become resistant to tobramycin, although on 3 occasions colonization with new resistant gram-negative bacilli occurred. In 6 out of 8 courses of therapy patients showed clinical improvement. Elimination of bacterial pathogens from the sputum was rarely achieved and was not necessary to produce clinical improvement. Colonization with resistant flora was an uncommon finding. Tobramycin's side effects were limited to local discomfort at the injection site, nausea and vomiting.</ABSTRACT>
