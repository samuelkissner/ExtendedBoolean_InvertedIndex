<TITLE>The visibly fatty liver.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Fatty infiltration of the liver has been identified roentgenographically in several young children. Awareness of this possibility will sometimes allow a radiologist to contribute to the understanding of the patient's metabolic and nutritional state. If a child's liver is shown to be abnormally radiolucent, cystic fibrosis should be considered.</ABSTRACT>
