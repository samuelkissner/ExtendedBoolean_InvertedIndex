<TITLE>Relationship between response to exercise and allergy in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Responses to treadmill exercise of 36 patients with cystic fibrosis were studied to evaluate their usefulness in identifying those with atopy. Ten of 36 patients with cystic fibrosis (28%) had an abnormal response to exercise but had no more frequent atopic characteristics than those who had normal exercise responses. Response to treadmill exercise alone cannot identify patients with atopic disease among those with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
