<TITLE>Membrane function in cystic fibrosis. II. Methionine transport in normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Initial rate kinetics of methionine transport, time course of accumulation of methionine, and efflux of accumulated methionine were studied in three normal and four CF human diploid fibroblast strains. The range of apparent Km's was 12.7-32.1 micrometer for the CF strains and 18.3-39.2 micrometer for the normal strains. The range of apparent Vmax's was 6.69-9.22 nmole mg-1 min-1 for the CF strains and 5.59-7.87 nmole mg-1 min-1 for the normal strains. The patterns of accumulation and efflux are quite similar in all the strains studied except for WI-38, which showed somewhat higher efflux and lower accumulation than for others. There was no significant difference in the kinetic parameters of methionine transport between CF and normal skin fibroblasts, and methionine transport will not serve as a marker for cystic fibrosis in cultured fibroblasts.</ABSTRACT>
