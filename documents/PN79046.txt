<TITLE>Biological activities of cystic fibrosis serum. III. CF serum induced uptake of 45Ca++ by rabbit tracheal explants.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Cystic Fibrosis (CF) serum and its isolated component IgG fraction produce an increased uptake of 45Ca++ in rabbit tracheal explants when compared to control serum and its isolated IgG fraction. Heterozygote serum also produced an increased uptake of 45Ca++ but not to the same extent as CF serum. The calcium channel blocker D600 inhibited the CF serum induced uptake of 45Ca++ indicating that CF serum may be acting on the plasma membrane to produce changes in calcium permeability in rabbit tracheal explants.</ABSTRACT>
