<TITLE>The chronically reserpinized rat as a possible model for cystic fibrosis. II. Comparison and cilioinhibitory effects of submaxillary saliva.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Submaxillary saliva from reserpine-treated rats was found to have alterations in composition similar to those reported in the same secretion from patients with cystic fibrosis. Changes included elevated concentrations of Na+, Ca++, protein, and carbohydrate. In addition, this saliva was found to have ciliotoxic properties similar to those of CF serum. The similarities in cilioinhibitory effects salivary composition, and histologic appearance justify the use of the chronically reserpinized rat as a model for cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
