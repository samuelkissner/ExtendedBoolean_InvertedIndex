<TITLE>Endobronchial balloon tamponade of hemoptysis in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The flexible bronchoscope with Fogarty balloon and irrigating catheters is used effectively to manage and treat hemoptysis in a series of patients with cystic fibrosis. This procedure is well suited to such patients, who are prone to recurrent hemoptysis, and may also be indicated in any inoperable patient with poor cardiopulmonary reserve.</ABSTRACT>
