<TITLE>Cystic fibrosis serum promotes [45Ca] uptake by normal human leukocytes.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A two-fold increase in [45Ca] labeling was observed when normal human leukocytes were incubated in the presence of serum obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis. The degree of [45Ca] labeling of leukocytes isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis was also significantly greater than that observed for leukocytes that had been isolated from normal individuals.</ABSTRACT>
