<TITLE>Quantitative assessment of regional ventilation and perfusion in children with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Twenty-five children aged 8 months to 17 years were studied to determine the usefulness of computer-assisted ventilation-perfusion (V-P) scanning in analysis of regional pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis. Ventilation and perfusion scintiphotographs were compared with the patients' radiographs. Regional fractional exchanges of air and relative regional V-P ratios were obtained. Whole-lung air-exchange was significantly correlated with standard pulmonary function tests and radiograph scores. Ventilation-perfusion ratio gradients were reversed in pats with predominantly upper zone disease, and regional V-P ratios were uneven in distribution. Quantitative assessment of regional ventilation and perfusion is a useful technique for assessing severity of pulmonary disease in children with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
