<TITLE>Steatorrhea, a simple and rapid method of diagnosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A simple and rapid method for the diagnosis of steatorrhea is described. The method is based on the assessment of the difference of specific gravity and lipophilic property between a normal stool and that in steatorrhea, using a benzene-NaBr system. The stool samples are dried, pulverized, and then investigated. Steatorrhea is defined either as a fat or more in a 24-hour sample. Stool samples of 71 infants and children were examined. Among these were 23 healthy subjects, 10 with upper respiratory tract infections, and 6 with pneumonia. A further 31 children had celiac disease, 9 of them were on a gluten-free diet, and one child had cystic fibrosis. The procedure described renders single stool samples suitable for the assessment of steatorrhea. As a screening test the method proved to be rapid and accurate in the diagnosis of steatorrhea.</ABSTRACT>
