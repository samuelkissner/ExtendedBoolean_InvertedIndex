<TITLE>Increased uptake of 35S-heparin by lymphocytes from patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Previous studies on cystic fibrosis (C.F.) have shown increased mucopolysaccharide synthesis in C.F. cells. The uptake of 35S-heparin sulphonate into purified lymphocytes was examined after 3 days' culture in medium 199 supplemented with 20% autochthonous plasma. Fourteen C.F. homozygotes, seven siblings, and nine parents all showed significantly greater uptake (p &lt; 0.001) of 35S-heparin than cultures from twenty-three normal controls. There was partial overlap in heparin-uptake values between C.F. patients and their families. This procedure thus differentiates C.F. families from the normal population, but does not differentiate C.F. homozygotes from heterozygotes. It is hoped that either variations in culture methods or a combination of this procedure with other measurements of C.F., such as ciliary dyskinesis or cellular metachromasia, will permit unequivocal identification of C.F. carriers.</ABSTRACT>
