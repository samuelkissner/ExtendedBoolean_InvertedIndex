<TITLE>Regional pediatric pulmonary centers in Ohio.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Acute and chronic respiratory disorders play a large role in the practitioner's daily care of infants, children, and adolescents. To assist with the more sophisticated problems in these diseases, the Ohio Committee on Pulmonary Standards has established pediatric pulmonary care centers distributed over the State of Ohio. Referral to these centers may be requested by the practicing physician. To illustrate the validity of this concept, this article reviews the care given to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the improved prognosis for this disease entity, and the advantages of expertise and of centralized care.</ABSTRACT>
