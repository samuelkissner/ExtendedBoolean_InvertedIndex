<TITLE>Cystic fibrosis: comparison of two mucolytic drugs for inhalation treatment (acetylcysteine and arginine hydrochloride).</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Clinical, bronchoscopic, spirographic, scintigraphic, and chemical analyses were done in 24 children with cystic fibrosis to assess the mucolytic effects of acetylcysteine inhalations versus L-arginine hydrochloride aerosols. The latter drug is less active than acetylcysteine and should not be used to treat children with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
