<TITLE>Bronchiectasis and mucoviscidosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Sweat chloride of 25 healthy adults was tested by iontophoresis method as a control. The mean value was 27.4 plus or minus 15.4 mEq./l. Thirty-six adult patients of bronchiectasis proved by bronchography was investigated for mucoviscidosis. If a patient had sweat chloride above 60 mEq./l., it was considered to be diagnostic of mucoviscidosis. Five (13.9 per cent) of 36 adult bronchiectasis patients had mucoviscidosis. The mean value of sweat chloride in 31 adult bronchiectasis patients was 32.9 plus or minus 11.7 mEq./l. The mean value of sweat chloride in 36 adult bronchiectasis patients (including 5 mucoviscidosis patients) was 42.3 plus or minus 26.8 mEq./l. Of 36 patients 18 had cylindrical type and 18 had saccular type of bronchiectasis. Three (16.6 per cent) out of 18 cylindrical type of bronchiectasis patients and 2 (11.1 per cent) of 18 saccular type of bronchiectasis patients had mucoviscidosis. Five (13.9 per cent) patients had emphysema and 6 (16.6 per cent) patients had emphysema with cor pulmonale. One patient of each group had mucoviscidosis. ECG showed P-pulmonale in 3 (8.3 per cent) patients one of whom had mucoviscidosis. Only one mucoviscidosis patient had coagulase positive Staph. aureus in sputum.</ABSTRACT>
