<TITLE>The chronically reserpinized rat as a possible animal model for cystic fibrosis. IV. The protein composition of pulmonary lavage fluid.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Lung lavage samples obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) had significantly higher levels of total protein per ml lavage fluid (0.49 vs. 0.30 mg/ml). A significant increase in the absolute and relative amounts of a low molecular weight glycoprotein (15,000 mol wt) was noted in lavage specimens from CF patients. Reserpine-treated rats also showed a significant increase in the total protein recovered in the lung lavage fluid with a 233% increase in the absolute and relative amounts of a low molecular weight glycoprotein (15,000 mol wt). Thus, reserpine induced changes in the secretions of the lung of the rat which are similar to those observed in samples obtained from the lung of CF patients.</ABSTRACT>
