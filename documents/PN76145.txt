<TITLE>Pathophysiology of mucus secretion in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Abnormality of mucus secretion, either biochemical or physical, has long been claimed to be the primary cause of pulmonary complications - obstruction and infection - in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). This review will draw in large measure on the experience of Prof. L. Reid and her research team who over the last 15 years have studied mucus-secreting structures and their secretions in the normal and diseased lung from various angles: development, structure and ultrastructure, histochemistry organ culture, biochemical analysis and rheological characterization.</ABSTRACT>
