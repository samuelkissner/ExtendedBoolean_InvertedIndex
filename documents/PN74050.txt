<TITLE>Failure of bronchopulmonary lavage in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In an attempt to retard deterioration of pulmonary function, a young man with cystic fibrosis underwent broncho-pulmonary lavage of an entire lung. In spite of theoretical advantages, the lavage produced an acute deterioration in the patient's clinical and physiologic status, from which he had not recovered one month later. We conclude that bronchopulmonary lavage in cystic fibrosis may be hazardous and should be reserved for those cases in which conventional methods of improving tracheobronchial clearance have failed.</ABSTRACT>
