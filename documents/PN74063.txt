<TITLE>Serum protein paper electrophoresis in cystic fibrosis correlated with bacteriological lung findings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Serum proteins have been studied by means of paper electrophoresis in 88 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and correlated with bacteriological lung findings. An increase of all serum globulin fractions in CF patients was found, whereas albumin and albumin/globulin ratio were decreased. The changes in all serum protein fractions were significantly greater in patients with constant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the lungs than in patients without this constant infection (p &lt; 0.005), whereas patients with intermittent pseudomonas infection did not have more severe changes than patients without pseudomonas infection. The changes in gamma-globulin and total globulin were significantly greater in patients with frequent Staphylococcus aureus infections than in patients with rare Staphylococcus aureus infections (p &lt; 0.005 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). As regards the other serum protein fractions, no significant differences between patients with frequent and rare staphylococcus infections were found. Judged by simple scoring systems, the lung disease of patients with constant pseudomonas infection was significantly more progressed clinically and radiologically than that of patients without constant pseudomonas infection (p &lt; 0.00005), whereas no significant differences were found between the other patient groups.</ABSTRACT>
