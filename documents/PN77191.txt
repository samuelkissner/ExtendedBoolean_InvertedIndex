<TITLE>Late-onset intestinal obstruction in cystic fibrosis--meconium ileus equivalent.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Four patients who suffered from cystic fibrosis and late-onset bowel obstruction (meconium ileus equivalent), and who were treated by surgery, are discussed. The importance of early correct diagnosis is stressed, since surgery may be prevented if bowel washouts and oral medications are given before the condition becomes complicated.</ABSTRACT>
