<TITLE>Bronchial drainage with aerosol medications in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Examined in this study are the immediate effects of bronchial drainage preceded by the inhalation of aerosol solutions of a mucolytic agent, a bronchodilator, and their combination upon four measures of pulmonary function in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis. On three separate occasions, pulmonary function was tested preceding and following treatments consisting of one of the above three aerosol solutions followed by bronchial drainage. The order of solutions used was random and each subject received one treatment with each solution. The greatest overall improvement in function was seen with the bronchodilator and bronchial drainage. The combination of the bronchodilator/mucolytic agents and bronchial drainage was the next most effective technique. The mucolytic agent, when used alone with bronchial drainage, decreased function. Comparison of the pulmonary function scores indicated a significant difference among the three treatments.</ABSTRACT>
