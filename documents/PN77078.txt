<TITLE>Meconium ileus equivalent complicating cystic fibrosis in postneonatal children and young adults. Report of 12 cases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Twelve patients with meconium ileus equivalent complicating cystic fibrosis in the postneonatal period were seen at the Mayo Clinic in the years 1950 through 1975. In a child or young adult with known or suspected cystic fibrosis, the triad of recurrent colicky abdominal pain, a mass in the right lower quadrant, and mechanical intestinal obstruction provides a clue to diagnosis of meconium ileus equivalent. The clinical suspicion of meconium ileus equivalent may be confirmed by meglumine diatrizoate (Gastrografin) enema, which in most uncomplicated cases also serves as treatment.</ABSTRACT>
