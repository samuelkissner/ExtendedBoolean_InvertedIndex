<TITLE>Cytoplasmic metachromasia in cultured skin fibroblasts from parents of children with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The cytoplasmic metachromasia phenomenon with Toluidine Blue 0 in cultured skin fibroblasts was studied in 12 parents of children with cystic fibrosis and in 12 controls. Positive findings were recorded in 10 of the CF parents and in one of the controls. The average culture time required for development of maximum metachromasia in positive cases was six weeks. The possible significance of the ametachromatic CF patients in relation to the suggested genetic heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis is discussed.</ABSTRACT>
