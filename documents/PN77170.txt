<TITLE>Blood volume changes in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Simultaneous red blood cell (RBC) and plasma volume determinations were obtained in 16 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and moderately severe pulmonary involvement. Hypervolemia with an increase in both RBC and plasma volumes was observed. Changes in blood volume were marked when values were indexed by weight but less significant when indexed by height. Decreasing systemic arterial oxygen saturation was associated with a progressive increase in RBC mass, hematocrit value, and hemoglobin level and a decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. RBC and total blood volumes were highest in patients with cor pulmonale and congestive heart failure. However, the compensatory polycythemic response in patients with CF was inadequate when compared with the response to hypoxemia in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease. The insufficient oxygen-carrying capacity may compromise tissue oxygen delivery and necessitate treatment.</ABSTRACT>
