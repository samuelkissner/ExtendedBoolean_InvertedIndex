<ABSTRACT>Although bronchoscopy remains the best definitive method for localization of the site of hemorrhage in patients who have massive hemopytsis, angiography remains an important adjunct to this localization. When combined with embolization of the bleeding bronchial artery, it is an effective method of therapy for the management of massive hemoptysis in patients with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
