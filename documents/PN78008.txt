<TITLE>Is sulphated blood-group substance in pancreas a factor in cystic fibrosis?.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The present study showed that the pancreas of two monkey species contained sulphated blood-group substance. Such strongly anionic molecules are known to bind calcium, and their solutions form gels in the presence of cations. It is suggested that such a mechanism may be involved in cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
