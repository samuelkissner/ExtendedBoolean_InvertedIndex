<TITLE>Cystic fibrosis presenting with the meconium plug syndrome.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The meconium plug syndrome (MPS) is a common cause of low intestinal obstruction in newborn infants. Usually, it is benign and not associated with other intestinal dysfunction. We describe the cases of three infants in whom there was intestinal obstruction consistent with the MPS and in which cystic fibrosis (CF) was later documented. We suggest that there is an association between the MPS and CF, and that the condition of all infants with the MPS be evaluated for the possibility of both Hirschsprung's disease and CF.</ABSTRACT>
