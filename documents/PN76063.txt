<TITLE>Cystic fibrosis: normal volumes of red cells. Model experiments on the pathomechanism of the disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Normal values of mean cell volume (M.C.V.) and of distribution of single cell volumes (S.C.V.) have been observed in erythrocytes of patients with cystic fibrosis using an electronical particle-volume analyzer (sheath flow detector). From these results a strong defect in red cell salt transport seems improbable. Valinomucin induces shrinking (by increase of K+ permeability) and gramicidin D induces swelling (by increase of Na+ permeability) of normal erythrocytes. Addition of C.F. sweat to normal erythrocytes induces no volume change. From this result no influence of the "C.F. factor" on passive ion permeability is concluded.</ABSTRACT>
