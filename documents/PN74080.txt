<TITLE>Pyocin typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Over the last 10 years, pyocin typing has been a useful tool for the epidemiological fingerprinting of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The widely used "scrape-and-streak" method of Gillies and Govan, although simple to perform, has not been sensitive enough in differentiation of strains. Use of additional indicator strains might correct this deficiency. The "growth-in-broth" method of typing has shown promise; because it is easily automated, it may become the method of choice when very sensitive results are required. The value of pyocin typing appears to be well established in the study of nosocomial infections; however, in some situations it may give misleading results. Further studies are required for demonstration of the relative value and relationships of serological, pyocin, and bacteriophage typing.</ABSTRACT>
