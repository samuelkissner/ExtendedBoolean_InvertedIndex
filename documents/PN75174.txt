<TITLE>Selective bronchial arteriography in patients with cystic fibrosis and massive hemoptysis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Massive hemoptysis is a potentially fatal complication of long- standing cystic fibrosis. Lobectomy may prevent a hemorrhagic death if the hemorrhage source can be identified and if involvement of the remaining lung tissue is mild. Selective bronchial arteriography was performed in six patients with cystic fibrosis to localize a lobar source of bleeding. Arteriographic findings correlated with bronchoscopic observations. Bronchial arteriography may be helpful when bronchoscopy cannot be done because of continuous hemorrhage or because the severity of the lung disease precludes general anesthesia, but it is not an adequate substitute for bronchoscopy in most patients.</ABSTRACT>
