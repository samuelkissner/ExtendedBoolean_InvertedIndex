<TITLE>Alpha-fetoprotein in serum and amniotic fluid in the diagnosis of neonatal hepatitis syndrome, Indian childhood cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis, ataxia telangiectasia and spina bifida.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Alpha-fetoprotein (A.F.P.) was detected and quantitated by the methods of immunodiffusion in agarose, counterimmunoelectrophoresis and radioimmunoassay. Serum A.F.P. level was raised in patients and siblings of Indian childhood cirrhosis, cystic fibrosis homozygotes heterozygotes, neonatal hepatitis and ataxia telangiectasia. It was mildly elevated in biliary atresia. In women with previous history of a child with severe neural tube defect, raised amniotic fluid levels of A.F.P. were associated with anencephaly or spina bifida. The diagnostic utility of A.F.P. in pediatrics, especially in genetic counselling, is discussed.</ABSTRACT>
