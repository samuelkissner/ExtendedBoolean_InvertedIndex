<TITLE>Clinical variations of cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>It is estimated that cystic fibrosis affects approximately one of every 2,000 white children born in the United States, and is now generally regarded as the commonest serious metabolic disorder of white children with the exception of diabetes mellitus. Its occurrence in children of Afro-Americans is quite rare and exceedingly so in those of Oriental extraction. Since cystic fibrosis is genetically determined as an autosomal recessive trait, and since the obligate heterozygote parent is entirely asymptomatic, the disease on its first occurrence in a given family can only be suspected by its manifestations in the patient himself. At present there is no test available for the detection of cystic fibrosis which can be applied as a simple, practical screening test, such as is available for phenylketonuria. Diagnostic tests are, therefore, used to confirm or refute the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis when suggestive symptoms arise or when a sibling or relative is known to have the disease.</ABSTRACT>
