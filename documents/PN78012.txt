<TITLE>Exocrine disorder in asthmatics: demonstration of high sweat chloride levels in chronic patients and their relatives.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In 87 patients with svere chronic asthma, the sweat chloride (Cl) level was determined, and increased concentrations were found in 12 (13.7%). In 76% of the relatives of these patients increased sweat Cl levels were also found. The authors give data of their clinical and allergy study and conclude that 13.7% of the patients under investigation had clinical characteristics of asthma, allergy and a functional exocrine disorder. The exocrinopathy may be an important factor in the pathophysiology of certain types of asthma.</ABSTRACT>
