<TITLE>Colonization by Enterobacteriaceae of the respiratory tract of children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and their antibody response.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Of 72 patients with fibrosis, 49 harbored Enterobacteriaceae in the respiratory tract, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. Colonization by two to four genera was documented in 29 subjects. Staphylococcus aureus was recovered from 44 of these 49 patients. The distribution of serogroups of E. coli was similar to that seen in patients with urinary tract infection. Antibody response against the O antigens of the patients' own Enterobacteriaceae was documented in 29 of these 49 children and encountered more often in patients with severe disease. Colonization by Enterobacteriaceae in the absence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was seen more frequently in children with the mild form of the illness.</ABSTRACT>
