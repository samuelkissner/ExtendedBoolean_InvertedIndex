<TITLE>Protease deficiency in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis. Reduced reaction of 4-methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate with plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Protease activity in plasma is assayed using 4- methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate. The assay is modified by carrying out the reaction in the presence and absence of benzamidine, a competitive inhibitor of trypsin-like proteases. The parameters of the assay are described in detail. Using this assay, our earlier demonstration of a deficiency of protease activity in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis is confirmed. The activity, corrected for the nonspecific hydrolysis of 4- methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate by benzamidine, is expressed as nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone released per milliliter plasma. Under standard conditions, the activity in plasma activated with chloroform-ellagic acid was 127.2 +/- 23.1 in 7 controls, 70.4 +/- 11.7 in 11 obligate heterozygotes, and 48.7 +/- 16.6 in 12 patients with cystic fibrosis. Identical results were obtained when unactivated plasma was used. These data demonstrate that the judicious use of specific inhibitors such as benzamidine might be useful in assaying low levels of protease activity in crude systems.</ABSTRACT>
