<TITLE>Unusual clinical course in a child with cystic fibrosis treated with fat emulsion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A child diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis by customary criteria has been given regular parenteral soya oil emulsion from near birth. Sweat tests have improved, pancreatic achylia was relieved, and the child at present remains entirely well. Correction of the essential fatty acid deficiency found in cystic fibrosis may prevent some of the manifestations of the disease.</ABSTRACT>
