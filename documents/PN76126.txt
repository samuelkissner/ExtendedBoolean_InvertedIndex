<TITLE>pH of sweat of patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>pH of the sweat from patients with cystic fibrosis and in controls was measured as a function of the sweat-rate using a fluorescence-pH- indicator (umbelliferone). In both populations sweat is acid at low sweat-rates and alkaline at high ones. The results do not favour an abnormality of the ductal H+-secretion as the pathomechanism of cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
