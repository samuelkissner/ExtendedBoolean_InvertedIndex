<TITLE>The influence of cystic fibrosis serum and calcium on secretion in the rabbit tracheal mucociliary apparatus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Cystic Fibrosis serum or its isolated component IgG fraction and calcium ionophore A23187 all produced a quantitatively greater increase of mucus glycoprotein secretion in the rabbit tracheal epithelium than did control serum or its isolated component IgG fraction. These values were determined by dry weight secretion per gram of tissue and on subsequent sialic acid content of secretions. This demonstrable increase in mucus production represents a measurable difference in the functioning of the cultured mucociliary apparatus due to the influence of cystic fibrosis serum.</ABSTRACT>
