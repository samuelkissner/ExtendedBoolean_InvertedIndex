<TITLE>Evaluation of bronchial drainage in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Examined in this study are the results of six tests of pulmonary function immediately preceding and following bronchial drainage in twenty-six patients with cystic fibrosis. Highly significant increases averaging 5.67, 4.13, 13.47, and 6.98 percent occurred in peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, expiratory reserve volume, and inspiratory capacity respectively. Significant increases in peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, and inspiratory capacity were observed in a subgroup of six of the above patients who had evidence of bronchospasm. The authors conclude that bronchial drainage will produce significant increases in routine pulmonary function values. The results suggest that this treatment is most effective in clearing the larger, more proximal, airways and is of benefit even in the presence of clinical bronchospasm.</ABSTRACT>
