<TITLE>Hemolytic anemia and edema as the initial signs in infants with cystic fibrosis. Consider this diagnosis even in absence of pulmonary symptoms.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>This is a report of five infants eventually proven to have cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, who presented with hemolytic anemia and edema. Since the sweat test is often unreliable in edematous states, the possibility of cystic fibrosis should be considered. Use of either a protein hydrolysate or addition of pancreatic enzymes will improve nutritional status, and when edema disappears, a definite sweat test can be performed. Evidence of vitamin E deficiency in some of the cases is presented, and the possibility of this as a cause of anemia is raised.</ABSTRACT>
