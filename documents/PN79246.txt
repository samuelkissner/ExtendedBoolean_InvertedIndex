<TITLE>Cystic fibrosis--its surgical presentation.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In a series of 62 cases of cystic fibrosis presenting at the Transvaal Memorial Hospital for Children, Johannesburg, during the 10-year period 1968-1978, 15 patients required surgical treatment for 17 complications of the disease. Meconium ileus, rectal prolapse, intussusception and ethmoiditis were the commonest surgical presentations, and portal hypertension, bronchial obstruction and nasal polyposis were also experienced. As the basic defect is unknown, treatment today is still directed towards these usually unpredictable secondary consequences.</ABSTRACT>
