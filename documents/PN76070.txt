<TITLE>Differences in the frequency distribution of DNA and dry mass per cell in lymphocytes derived from cystic fibrosis patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The DNA and dry mass content of lymphocytes of normal controls, heterozygotic and cystic fibrosis patients have been studied utilizing biophysical instrumentation. The lymphocytes from CF had Feulgen-DNA mean values significantly lower than the normal controls. DNA values for CF lymphocytes exhibited two sub-population values. The mean dry mass (total protein) values exhibited greater intercellular variability among CF cells. The dry mass:DNA ratio was higher in CF than in normal controls, and this ratio appeared to increase concomitantly with advance of disease.</ABSTRACT>
