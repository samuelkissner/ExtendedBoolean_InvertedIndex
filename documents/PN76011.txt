<TITLE>Third component of complement in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In a study of C3 levels and phenotypes in 64 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, 92 CF parents, 64 normal siblings, and 126 healthy controls, significant elevations of mean C3 levels were found in CF patients, their parents, and in one genetic sub-group of their siblins (SS females). C3 concentration in CF patients correlated with the degree of clinical impairment as measured by Shwachman-Kulczycki (S-K) score. No significant differences were found in the prevalences of C3 phenotypes or the S and F gene frequencies among the groups studied.</ABSTRACT>
