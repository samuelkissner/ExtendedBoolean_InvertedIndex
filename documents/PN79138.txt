<TITLE>Brain abscess and cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Brain abscess has only recently been considered a complication of cystic fibrosis. Three patients are reported here and a fourth cited from the literature. All of our patients were young adults with advanced pulmonary disease. The bacteria involved were mouth organisms and were found in the sputum culture in only one of the patients. Resistance was present to previously given antibiotics. As patients with cystic fibrosis survive into adulthood, the risk of developing a brain abscess appears to increase.</ABSTRACT>
