<TITLE>Intussusception in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A 16-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis had intermittent episodes of abdominal pain probably due to recurrent intussusceptions. This type of bowel obstruction is probably more frequent in patients with fibrocystic disease. Thick, vascid, inspissated feces appears to be the cause of the intussusceptions. Prevention of the inspissation may reduce the incidence of these obstructions. The treatment for this problem is the same as in other (noncystic) patients.</ABSTRACT>
