<TITLE>The source of Na+ and Cl- activities on the skin surface. Experiences with electrode measurements in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>We have used ion-specific electrodes in an attempt to map the sodium and chloride activities on the skin under differing surface conditions. The range of values and the standard deviations are so wide that a baseline for the untreated dry skin is precluded. In patients with cystic fibrosis, a wide range of values is also found. For this group, measurements on dry skin taken immediately after washing were in the same low range as for healthy subjects. The range of measurements on the dry skin of newborn infants was similar for full-term infants with reactive sweat glands and for premature infants who failed to show sweating responsiveness to natural reflex stimulation as well as local glandular stimulation with sudorific drugs. For only two conditions have measurements of sodium and chloride activities on the surface of the skin been of value: (1) on the sweat-covered skin for the detection of the high values encountered in cystic fibrosis, and (2) on the dry skin surface, deprived of autonomic innervation (spinal paraplegia), extremely low sodium and chloride activities reflect absent gland activity.</ABSTRACT>
