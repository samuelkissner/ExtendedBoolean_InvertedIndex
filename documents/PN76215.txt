<TITLE>Cultured cells in cystic fibrosis research: A review.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common inherited disorder which is characterized by the production of exocrine secretions with elevated ion content and abnormally viscous mucus. Over the last few years cells obtained from the peripheral blood or cultured from tissues of cystic fibrosis patients have been used increasingly in the study of the disease. Investigations of the following properties of cystic fibrosis cells are reviewed: morphology, ultrastructure, growth kinetics, cellular metachromasia, the production of ciliary inhibitors, cellular composition, plasma membrane composition, the transport of inorganic ions and small organic molecules, lysosomal enzyme content, and RNA methylation. Studies of the effects on cultured cells and erythrocyte membranes of factors in CF cell culture medium and biological fluids from CF patients are discussed.</ABSTRACT>
