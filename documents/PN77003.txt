<TITLE>Insulin and glucagon response to arginine infusion in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The glucagon and insulin responses to intravenous arginine were studied in 17 children with cystic fibrosis and in 9 control children. It was found that the overall secretion of insulin was diminished; however, four of the CF children did have a normal output. The glucagon responses did not parallel those of insulin. The glucagon output varied in the CF children--seven had normal, four excessively high and six low output. Three of the four children with extremely high output had more severe disease and were below the third centile on the weight chart. These four had a fasting hypoglycaemia and also a very low glucose and insulin response. We have confirmed diminished insulin secretion in cystic fibrosis, but diminished glucagon secretion was only noted when some insulin secretion was preserved. The high levels of glucagon seen in the most insulin deficient subjects may be derived from extrapancreatic sources, or may be associated with 'stress' reaction in these patients who also had most severe pulmonary involvement. The data would be consistent with diminished glucagon and insulin secretion from the pancreas but as the disease progresses an excessive secretion of extra pancreatic glucagon results.</ABSTRACT>
