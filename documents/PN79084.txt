<TITLE>Study of the oligosaccharide units from mucus glycoproteins of meconium from normal infants and from cases of cystic fibrosis with meconium ileus.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>1. The mucus glycoproteins in meconium from normal infants and from infants having cystic fibrosis with meconium ileus have been studied. 2. Whereas normal meconium contained about 50% protein-bound carbohydrate, the meconium from cystic fibrosis contained only about 10%. 3. Glycopolypeptides were prepared from the mucus of glycoproteins. The oligosaccharide units from this material were released and fractionated. The fractions ranged widely in size and composition. 4. The fractions from cystic fibrosis specimens had a significantly higher content of fucose than those from normal specimens.</ABSTRACT>
