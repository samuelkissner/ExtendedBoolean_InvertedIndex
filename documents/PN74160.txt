<TITLE>Tobramycin treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Tobramycin treatment of chronic pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 13 children with cystic fibrosis was evaluated. Initially the patients received the recommended dose of 125 mg/m2/24 hours; the dose was then increased to 250 mg/m2/24 hours (approximately 10 mg/kg/24 hours). This higher dosage was administered intramuscularly to 9 patients. Eight of these received additional therapy with an aerosol containing tobramycin. With this therapy it was possible to eradicate Ps. aeruginosa from the respiratory tract in 5 of the patients. After discontinuing therapy Ps. aeruginosa re-occurred in all patients within one month. All patients showed a clinical improvement in relation to therapy. No toxic or allergic side effects were observed.</ABSTRACT>
