<TITLE>Paneth cell metaplasia in diseases of the colon and rectum.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Paneth cell metaplasia is a variable feature of diverse diseases of the colon and rectum. Paneth cells are numerous in the atrophic mucosa of chronic ulcerative colitis, in some juvenile polyps, and around colloid (mucinous) carcinomas. Moderate numbers of Paneth cells are found in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, ambeic colitis, and in villous adenomas. Paneth cells are sparse in diverticulitis, in adenomatous polyps, and around nonmucinous carcinomas. In this study, Paneth cell metaplasia is associated with mucus hypersecretion and mucin deposits. It is suggested that one function of the Paneth cell is to control gastrointestinal mucin viscosity.</ABSTRACT>
