<TITLE>Endocrine function of the pancreas in cystic fibrosis: evidence for an impaired glucagon and insulin response following arginine infusion.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Pancreatic glucagon and insulin were determined in 10 children with cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and in a control group following stimulation by an arginine infusion. In controls the infusion of arginine induced a prompt threefold elevation in plasma pancreatic glucagon and about a sixfold increase in plasma immunoreactive insulin. In patients with C.F. the average response of both hormones was considerably less, and the base-line concentrations for glucagon were lower. The data support the hypothesis that in C.F. both alpha- and beta-cell function are affected as a result of the underlying process.</ABSTRACT>
