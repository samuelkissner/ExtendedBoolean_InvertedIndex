<TITLE>The effect of spermidine and spermine on proliferation in vitro of fibroblasts from normal and cystic fibrosis patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The effects of spermidine and spermine at varying concentrations upon the replicative ability of human fibroblasts in cell culture have been studied. The average concentrations of spermidine causing a 50% inhibition of prolifertion (ID50) after 3 days of growth for three normal cell strains and three strains derived from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were 4.4 X 10(-6) +/- 1.2 M and 6.2 X 10(-6) +/- 2.1 M, respectively. The values for spermine were 2.0 X 10(-6) +/- 0.5 M for normal and 2.2 X 10(-6) +/- 0.1 M for fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients. No significant difference between the replicative ability of normal and CF cell strains was seen over a wide range of polyamine concentrations employed for a period of up to 3 days.</ABSTRACT>
