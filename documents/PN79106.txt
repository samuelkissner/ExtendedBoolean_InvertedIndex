<TITLE>Serotypes and antibiotic susceptibilities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from single sputa of cystic fibrosis patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A phenotypic characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from single sputum samples of 21 typical cystic fibrosis patients indicated a high frequency of heterogeneity among isolates on the basis of differences in antibiotic resistance, colony morphology, pigmentation, and serotype. Two or more isolates with different but stable susceptibilities to carnecillin, gentamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim were detected in 38% of the sputa. Differences generally were independent of the mucoid state of the strain. O- antigen group determination with the Difco typing set showed that two or more serologically distinct strains were present in 10/21 sputum specimens. Nonmucoid derivatives of mucoid isolates almost always retained both the antibiotic susceptibilities and serotype of their parent strain. These data suggest that cystic fibrosis patients may be cocolonized/coinfected by difference strains of P. aeruginosa more frequently than generally believed. Alternatively, phenotypically distinct strains from a single patient might arise as phenotypic dissociants from a single infecting strain. Because of the frequency and multiplicity of phenotypically distinct P. aeruginosa isolates which we obtained from our cystic fibrosis patients, it is important to select multiple isolates from sputum cultures for antimicrobial susceptibility testing so as to assess adequately the susceptibility of this organism to antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis. We recommend that several colonies of each distinguishable colony type of P. aeruginosa be pooled for the antibiogram.</ABSTRACT>
