<TITLE>Tropomyosin antibody: the specific localization of tropomyosin in nonmuscle cells.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>An antibody against purified chicken skeletal muscle tropomyosin is used in indirect immunofluorescence to visualize the localization of tropomyosin in a variety of nonmuscle cells. The antibody produces a fluorescent pattern which is very similar to that obtained with an actin-specific antibody. This pattern is composed of fluorescent fibers which are shown to be coincident with the fibers seen with phase-contrast optics. High resolution epifluorescent microscopy reveals that fibers stained with the actin antibody show a continuous fluorescence, while fibers reacted with the tropomyosin antibody show a periodic fluorescence. Measurements indicate that the lengths of the fluorescent segments are variable with an average of 1.2 mum while the spacing between segments is approximately 0.4 mum.</ABSTRACT>
