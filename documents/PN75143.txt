<TITLE>The chronically reserpinized rat as a possible model for cystic fibrosis. I. Submaxillary gland morphology and ultrastructure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Rats treated for 7 days with reserpine develop structural changes in the submaxillary gland that resemble those that have been reported in cystic fibrosis. The salivary exocrinopathy is characterized by increased amounts of PAS-reactive mucoprotein in the acinar cells and by obstruction and dilatation of ducts by precipitated material with the same staining characteristics as those found in the acinar elements.</ABSTRACT>
