<TITLE>Comparative trial of manual and mechanical percussion technique with gravity-assisted bronchial drainage in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Chest physiotherapy still remains one of the most important aspects in the treatment of chest complications of cystic fibrosis. A mechanical device that allows the patient with cystic fibrosis to do his own chest physiotherapy will be of great benefit if it is as effective as manual percussion. 14 patients with cystic fibrosis using mechanical and manual percussion physiotherapy were studied by measuring sputum volumes, and FEV and FVC. Results with mechanical percussor were as good as with the manual percussor and, therefore, it would be reasonable for the older patient to use the former on his own.</ABSTRACT>
