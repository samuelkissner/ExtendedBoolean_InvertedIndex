<TITLE>Psychosocial support for adults with cystic fibrosis: a group approach.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>This article describes the first time-limited psychosocial support group for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF).The chronology of the group is traced, focusing on issues of importance for health professionals who work with patients with CF. Some of the issues raised by patient members include doubts about the competence of nonpediatricians to adequately treat CF; resentment towards "normals" (those without CF), including health professionals; and the desire to control as many areas of their lives as possible. Covert (ie, unrecognized) issues, the role of staff, risks, and outcome are detailed as a guide for others who may wish to conduct such groups. The literature on groups for medical patients and a rationale for the beneficial effects on the group are given.</ABSTRACT>
