<TITLE>Measurement of regional lung function by tetrapolar electrical impedance plethysmography.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>This study demonstrates the clinical feasibility of atraumatically measuring dynamic regional lung function with tetrapolar electrical impedance plethysmography (EIP) in the pediatric age group. A tetrapolar electrode system was used because of its ability to detect local baseline and pulsatile impedance changes, minimal electrode- tissue impedance interference, and uniform current distribution. Studies performed on 4 children 4 to 15 years old with various pulmonary diseases are presented. The information obtained on their regional ventilation and pulsatile perfusion by EIP was found to agree closely with pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scans. In one case, EIP detected pulsatile perfusion abnormalities which were not apparent in the non-pulsatile perfusion scan but were demonstrated by cineangiography. It is concluded that tetrapolar EIP can provide safe, reliable regional information about ventilation and perfusion in diseased lungs, and because of its atraumatic approach, is technically most suitable for use in children.</ABSTRACT>
