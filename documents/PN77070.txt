<TITLE>Dysfunctional aspects of a supportive group.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A number of voluntary organizations exist for the support of patients and their relatives suffering from specific medical conditions. It is usually assumed that membership will provide positive emotional and social support but membership may provide dysfunctional responses. A small-scale study of parents of fibrocystic children provides some evidence of dysfunctional aspects of membership of one specific organization. Further research into the effects of formal and informal reference group activity and the types of support most acceptable to patients and their families is suggested.</ABSTRACT>
