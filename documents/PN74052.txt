<TITLE>Erythrocyte membrane properties in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The biochemical properties of the erythrocyte membrane have been studied in cystic fibrosis patients and in age-matched controls. No significant differences could be observed in either the concentration or composition of the principal membrane constituents. Contrary to previous reports, we found normal levels of the Mg2+-dependent and Ca2+ + Mg2+-dependent ATPase activities in CF preparations. However, a qualitative difference was observed in the Ca2+-dependent ATPase, since the enzyme had relatively greater activity at lower calcium concentrations in the cystic preparations. This effect on the membrane-bound Ca2+-ATPase is unlikely to represent a genetic defect in the enzyme itself but it may be connected with the mechanism of pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
