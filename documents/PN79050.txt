<TITLE>Plasma membrane lipids of human diploid fibroblasts from normal individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The lipid composition of isolated plasma membranes of human skin fibroblasts is described for the first time. Plasma membranes from a number of strains of fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis and matched normals were isolated by a recently described procedure and analysed for major phospholipid classes, cholesterol and fatty acids. No differences in the quantities of these compounds were detected between cells of the two different origins. The fetal calf serum used to supplement the growth medium contained relatively more palmitoleate and oleate but less stearate than the membranes. There were also no consistent differences between cystic fibrosis and normal membranes in terms of the fatty acid compositions of their individual phospholipid classes. Consistent with this lack of chemical change in the lipids of membranes of cystic fibrosis cells, the degree of fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene, an index of fluidity, was also unchanged.</ABSTRACT>
