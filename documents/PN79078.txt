<TITLE>Electrolytes and norepinephrine levels in blood of patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Young adults with cystic fibrosis in good to excellent condition have reduced plasma sodium and chloride and elevated plasma potassium compared to a group of healthy young adult control subjects. Blood pressure was also lower in the patients with cystic fibrosis. However, plasma norepinephrine and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and their response to standing and isometric hand grip were normal in the cystic fibrosis patients.</ABSTRACT>
