<TITLE>Environmental factors and diseases of the pancreas.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The five major diseases of the pancreas together make a significant contribution to morbidity and mortality among the people of the United States. These diseases are diabetes, cystic fibrosis, acute and chronic pancreatitis, and carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas. Four of these diseases can be modeled in laboratory animals by acute or chronic administration of chemical poisons or carcinogens. Human pancreatic diseases attributed to the effect of chemical agents including alcohol and drugs include many cases of chronic pancreatitis and some cases of acute pancreatitis. The cause is not known in many cases of human pancreatitis, including interstitial, acute, and chronic clinical forms. Epidemiologic studies suggest that the increasing incidence of carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas in the United States may reflect chemical carcinogenesis. On the basis of experimental observations, we know that pancreatic islet cells can be damaged directly by toxic chemicals, and that islet cell tumors can be chemically induced. Thus, there is adequate background data to conclude that several pancreatic diseases of obscure etiology may be due in part to hitherto unidentified toxic effects of chemical agents encountered in personal or general environments.</ABSTRACT>
