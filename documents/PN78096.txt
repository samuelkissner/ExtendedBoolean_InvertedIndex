<TITLE>Should we screen all newborns for cystic fibrosis?.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>To assess the value of detecting albumin in meconium as a screening procedure for cystic fibrosis [CF] 68,000 meconium samples were examined by BM Meconium Test, single radial immunodiffusion and benzidine reaction. The specificity and sensitivity of this combination of tests were 99.67% and 78.57% respectively. The prevalence of CF at birth was confirmed as 1:3600 in this country. This low prevalence resulted in a relatively high number of false positives. Therefore, a positive test result has a low predictive value [3.39%] and this is a serious drawback of the method. The experiences and opinions of 37 local paediatricians about the screening programme were evaluated by a simple questionnaire. Gold's decision rule was applied. The least relative cost of misclassification justifying a mass-screening programme was 3 times higher than the actual relative cost as suggested by the aggregate opinion of paediatricians in the region. These results support the view that with the methods used screening may have more disadvantages than not screening.</ABSTRACT>
