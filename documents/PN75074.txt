<TITLE>Mild cystic fibrosis presenting as an asymptomatic distended appendiceal mass: A case report.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A case of cystic fibrosis presenting as a right lower quadrant mass in a five-year-old white female is presented. At laparotomy, a mucoid, impacted appendix was found which microscopically suggested the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis must be added to conditions presenting with abdominal masses.</ABSTRACT>
