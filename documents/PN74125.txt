<TITLE>Number of ouabain-binding sites in fibroblasts from normal subjects and patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Autosomal recessive disease, is a defect in the net sodium transport in the eccrine glands resulting in an increased concentration of sodium in the sweat. Because of possible complications in the erythrocytes from CF patients, and since the activity observed in a cell homogenate may not express the situation in the intact cell, we have looked for differences in the binding of 3H-ouabain in cultured normal and CF human diploid fibroblasts. We observed no appreciable differences in the number of ouabain-binding sites between normal and CF cell strains. We were also unable to observe any differences in the kinetics of ouabain-binding between normal and CF fibroblasts in K+-free phosphate-buffered saline solution, and the results were essentially the same as those seen in HeLa cells. We observed no alterations in the kinetics of binding of ouabain nor any alteration in the total number of binding sites.</ABSTRACT>
