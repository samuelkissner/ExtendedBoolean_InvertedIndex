<TITLE>Upper respiratory tract in cystic fibrosis. Ear-nose-throat survey of 50 children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>An ear-nose-throat survey was carried out on 50 children aged 4 to 10 years with cystic fibrosis. 10% were shown to be transiently deaf, associated with eustachian tube dysfunction. There were no confirmed cases of secretory otitis media. 10 children (20%) were found to have nasal polyps or gave a history of polypectomy. Though a high incidence of middle ear problems in children with cystic fibrosis has been reported in the U.S.A., neither deafness nor secretory otitis media was found to be a problem in the group studied.</ABSTRACT>
