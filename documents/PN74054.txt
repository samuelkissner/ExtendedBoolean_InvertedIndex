<TITLE>Ca2+ uptake and binding by isolated erythrocyte membranes from cystic fibrosis and control subjects.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Ca2+-ATPase activity, high affinity Ca2+ binding in the presence and absence of ATP and low affinity Ca2+ binding at added CaCl2 concentrations of 1 microM, 100 microM and 10 mM were measured in isolated erythrocyte membranes from cystic fibrosis and control subjects. No significant difference was detected between the two groups for any of these measurements.</ABSTRACT>
