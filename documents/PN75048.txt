<TITLE>Cystic fibrosis: the ciliary inhibitor is a small polypeptide associated with immunoglobulin G.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A small polypeptide within the molecular weight range of 6,000 to 11,000 was found in immunoglobulin fractions from sera of cystic fibrosis homozygotes and heterozygotes. This factor appears to be responsible for interfering with ciliary activity in oyster gills. Since it can be dissociated from IgG without reductive cleavage it must be bound in a non-covalent manner. After its dissociation the IgG fractions from cystic fibrosis sera no longer inhibited ciliary activity. This finding explains the differences previously observed in the molecular weights of the ciliary inhibitor synthesized by cultured cells and that of sera from cystic fibrosis genotypes.</ABSTRACT>
