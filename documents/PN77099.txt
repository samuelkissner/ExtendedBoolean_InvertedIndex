<TITLE>Pharmacokinetics of methicillin in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The disposition of methicillin in normal subjects and in subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) was studied after administration of single intravenous doses of 15 mg/kg. The area under the serum concentration vs. time curve for CF patients was, on the average, only 75% of that found for normal subjects. The low concentrations in serum were caused by more rapid urinary excretion of the antibiotic, with rates of renal clearance averaging 425 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the patients with CF and 362 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the normal subjects. No differences were found in volumes of distribution and metabolic clearance rates of methicillin or in rates of creatinine clearance between the two groups of subjects. These data support previous findings with dicloxacillin which show that patients with CF exhibit unusually rapid, active tubular secretion of certain penicillins that may necessitate use of larger doses of these drugs in treatment of infections.</ABSTRACT>
