<TITLE>Comparative trial of pancrex V forte and nutrizym in treatment of malabsorption in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A cross-over trial of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy has been conducted on 12 children with cystic fibrosis using Pancrex V forte and Nutrizym tablets in equivalent dosage. No differences were found in the effectiveness of these products as measured by stool volume, number of bowel actions, faecal fat excretion, and urine urea excretion. Neither product eliminated the steatorrhoea. Though there was no laboratory evidence to support their choice nine patients expressed a preference for Nutrizym at the conclusion of the trial. This preference was based partly on the smaller number of tablets which are required.</ABSTRACT>
