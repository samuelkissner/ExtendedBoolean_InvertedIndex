<TITLE>Sweat testing for cystic fibrosis: characteristics of a combination chloride ion-selective electrode.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Filling solution leakage, reproducibility, stability, interferences and temperature effects have been studied in relation to the use of the Orion 96-17-01 combination chloride ion-selective electrode in sweat testing for cystic fibrosis. While stability and reproducibility is good, certain antiseptic systems and especially Hibitaine (chlorhexidine gluconate) interfere with the electrode and therefore need to be absent during sweat testing. Temperature conditions during calibration and sweat testing need to be controlled in view of the extent of response variations for even modest temperature differences between sensor-skin interface and electrode stem.</ABSTRACT>
