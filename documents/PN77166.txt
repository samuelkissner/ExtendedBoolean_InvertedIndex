<TITLE>Arginine esterase and lysosomal hydrolases in liver from cystic fibrosis subjects.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The total activity and isoelectric focusing patterns of arginine esterase, cathepsin B1, and several lysosomal hydrolases were normal in liver from two patients with cystic fibrosis. No abnormalities were observed in values for pH optimum, Km, and Vmax for arginine esterase and cathepsin B1 in liver from cystic fibrosis patients compared to those values for liver from the control subject. Soybean trypsin inhibitor at concentrations up to 100 microgram/ml had no effect on liver arginine esterase or cathepsin B1.</ABSTRACT>
