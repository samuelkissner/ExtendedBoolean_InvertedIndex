<TITLE>Rapid semiquantitative tests for trypsin and chymotrypsin application to screening for cystic fibrosis, enterokinase deficiency and pancreatic hypoplasia in neonates.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Methods for the rapid semiquantitative analyses of trypsin and chymotrypsin in faeces samples have been developed. The faecal sample is shaken with pH 8.2 buffer and solutions containing enzyme substrate, buffer and indicator are added. The sample is incubated at 37 degrees C for a period dependent on the amount of faecal material present and the colour noted. A change in colour from violet to yellow (trypsin) or green to rose (chymotrypsin) indicates the presence of the enzyme. A screening trial using these tests is being carried out at St. Helen's Maternity Hospital in Auckland.</ABSTRACT>
