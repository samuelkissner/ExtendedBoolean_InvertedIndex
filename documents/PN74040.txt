<TITLE>Ultrastructure of the in vitro formation of hydroxyapatite in submandibular saliva of children with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Calcium phosphate, which precipitates in submandibular saliva of patients with cystic fibrosis because of elevated calcium concentrations, was shown by electron microscopy to transform, on standing in vitro, from amorphous calcium phosphate globules to stellar clusters of hydroxyapatite crystals. Amorphous globules appeared to form at regular nucleation points on a fine network of unknown nature. Hydroxyapatite crystal formation was confirmed by electron diffraction pattern and chemical solubility. Zymogen-granule spherules (inclusion bodies), which are present in greatly increased numbers in cystic fibrosis submandibular saliva, disintegrated on standing from a homogeneous appearance to beaded, hollow spheres.</ABSTRACT>
