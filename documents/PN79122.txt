<TITLE>Normal neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The prominent role of infection in the clinical course of cystic fibrosis has led to considerable investigation of possible immune deficiency in these patients. Leukotaxis of circulating phagocytic cells and the ability to generate chemotactic factors are important in host defenses against bacterial invasion. These properties were investigated in patients with clinically stable cystic fibrosis to determine if they possess dysfunctional inflammatory responses which would predispose them to severe infection.</ABSTRACT>
