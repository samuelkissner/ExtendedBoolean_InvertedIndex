<TITLE>Conjunctival goblet cells in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In five patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the mucous glandular system of the conjunctiva was studied, as changes, if any, in the conjunctival goblet cells might be applicable as a diagnostic test in questionable cases. A whole-mount technique was used, specially developed for studying conjunctival goblet cells. In all five cases the qualitative as well as quantitative goblet-cell findings were in accordance with a previously reported normal material. In particular, there were no signs of stagnated secretion.</ABSTRACT>
