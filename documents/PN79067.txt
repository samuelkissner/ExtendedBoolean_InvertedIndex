<TITLE>Echocardiographic abnormalities in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>An echographic study was undertaken to evaluate left (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function in 30 patients with cystic fibrosis. Echographic recording of the pulmonary and aortic valve echogram permitted measurement of the phases of right and left ventricular systole. The ratio of the LV preejection period/LV ejection time (LPEP/LVET) and shortening of the LV internal dimension %SID was employed to reflect LV function, while RV preejection period/RV ejection time (RPEP/RVET) has excellent correlation with pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. RPEP/RVET and two other echographic measurements, right ventricular wall (RVW) and internal dimension (RVD) were compared with pulmonary function tests and clinical scores. RPEP/RVET correlated well with percent vital capacity(%VC), r = -0.73, percent residual volume (%RVol) r = +0.72, and clinical score, r = -0.77. Multilinear regression of RPEP/RVET, RVD, and RVW improved correlation for %VC (r = -0.80), %RVol, r = +0.82, and clinical score, r = -0.84. Patients in overt right heart failure exhibited elevated RPEP/RVET (mean = 0.48) when compared to patients not in right heart failure (mean = .33). Marked diminution of LV function was present in two patients. A variety of cardiovascular abnormalities were demonstrated echographically and were valuable in assessing the degree of cardiac involvement in patients with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
