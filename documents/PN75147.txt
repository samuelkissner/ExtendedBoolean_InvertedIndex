<TITLE>Polyamines in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Polyamine concentrations have been measured in blood samples from a series of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and control subjects. Analyses were made by a fluorometric method, in which the amines were reacted with dansyl chloride and separated by thin layer chromatography on Kieselguhr. There was no significant difference between the polyamine concentrations of blood samples from CF patients and control subjects. Also, the spermidine-spermine ratio was similar in both groups. Polyamines were also analyzed in exocrine fluids, and although none could be detected in either CF or control sweat or saliva, significant amounts of spermine and spermidine were present in all samples of bile and duodenal fluids. It thus seems likely that the biliary route is a significant pathway in the human for excretion of polyamines. The observation that polyamines are excreted in considerable concentrations via the bile in children may be of interest in view of the reports of elevated urinary polyamine concentrations in neoplastic states. Since measurable amounts of spermine and spermidine were detected in all six bile preparations available for this study, analysis of these substances in bile may be of benefit in particular cases.</ABSTRACT>
