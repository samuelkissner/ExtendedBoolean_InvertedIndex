<TITLE>Relationship between hepatic and pancreatic disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A voluminous literature has dealt with the variety of pathologic entities that may effect the liver and the pancreas. Much of it includes poorly or vaguely documented observations. Only a few facets have been subjected to experimental study. Despite the resultant difficulty in unraveling reported and inferred relationships between the two organs, the available information has been analyzed according to the following arbitrary categorization: (1) involvement of the liver in pancreatic disease, (2) involvement of the pancreas in hepatic disease, (3) involvement of both organs in systemic disease.</ABSTRACT>
