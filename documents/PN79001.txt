<TITLE>'Rusters'. The corrosive action of palmar sweat: I. Sodium chloride in sweat.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Sweat from 8 'rusters' and 8 control persons was examined for its sodium concentration. Sweating was induced by iontophoresis of pilocarpine on the distal forearm. In no case did the concentrations exceed the normal upper limit for this procedure, and no difference was found between the two groups. In this way the study failed to confirm earlier reports of elevated sodium chloride concentrations in sweat from 'rusters'. Proposals of a relationship between 'rusters' and patients with pancreatic cystic fibrosis were not substantiated. Hyperhidrosis of the palms and volar surfaces of the fingers was present in all 'rusters'. This seemed to be the main cause of the corrosive tendency, and patients referred for palmar hyperhidrosis were found to produce corrosion similar to the 'rusters'. Topical application of aluminium chloride hexahydrate in a 25% solution in absolute ethyl alcohol proved effective against both hyperhidrosis and the corrosive tendency.</ABSTRACT>
