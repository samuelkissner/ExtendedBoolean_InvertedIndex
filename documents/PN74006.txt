<TITLE>Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis. Distribution of B and T lymphocytes in relation to the humoral immune response.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The influence of chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection on the occurrence of bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells) and thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) in peripheral blood have been studied in 2 groups of patients with cystic fibrosis. One group (9 patients) suffered from chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection in the respiratory tract and produced multiple Ps. aeruginosa precipitins which were demonstrated by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The other group (9 patients) had never harboured Ps. aeruginosa in the respiratory tract and presented no demonstrable precipitins against this bacteria. The lymphocytes were examined for the presence of 2 surface markers for B cells: receptor for C3 complement component (EAC rosette-formation) and surface immunoglobulins (immunofluorescent staining), and for the presence of 1 surface marker for T cells: spontaneous binding of sheep red blood cells (E rosette-formation). The B:T cell ratio was nearly identical in the 2 groups of patients whereas the total numbers of B and T cells were significant higher in patients with chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection. The number of Ps. aeruginosa precipitins per serum was significantly positively correlated to the total number of T cells, wheras the correlation with the total number of B cells was insignificant.</ABSTRACT>
