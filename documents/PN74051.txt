<TITLE>The levels of galactosyltransferase activity in sera from normal children and patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The levels of galactosyltransferase have been studied in the sera obtained from 59 normal individuals varying in age from 5 - 19 years, and from 29 cystic fibrosis patients varying in age from 5 - 33 years. The enzyme level found in children was lower than that in adults. The levels in the sera of cystic fibrosis patients was found to be about half of that in the normal sera for the corresponding age group. In those cystic fibrosis patients over 20 years of age, normal levels were found.</ABSTRACT>
