<TITLE>Neonatal meconium obstruction in the ileum without mucoviscidosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Two newborns with intestinal obstruction of the terminal ileum without mucoviscidosis were cured by Gastrografin enema. A further case of a premature infant showed, at autopsy, a large intestine containing normal meconium, but an ileum which was plugged with tenacious meconium containing PAS-positive and alcian blue-negative mucus. Our 3 cases were similar to cases of "meconium disease" reported by Rickham and of "meconium plug in the small intestine" reported by Emery. The primary cause of this disease lies in the large amount of PAS-positive mucus secreted from goblet cells of the ileal mucosa and the hypertrophy of lymph nodules in the ileal submucosa.</ABSTRACT>
