<TITLE>Use of water vapor in the treatment of lower respiratory disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Use of bland aerosols, particularly mist tents, in the treatment of lower respiratory disease was reviewed and no convincing evidence of efficacy was found. This is not surprising because there is evidence that mist tents deposit little water in the lower respiratory tract. Mist tents may be detrimental, in some cases, because of bacterial contamination and because they can cause bronchospasm.</ABSTRACT>
