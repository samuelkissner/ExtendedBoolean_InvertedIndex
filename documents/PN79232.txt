<TITLE>Serum factor in cystic fibrosis: correlation with clinical parameters.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The relationship between the activity of the cystic fibrosis serum ciliary dyskinesia factor, detected by the rabbit tracheal bioassay, and clinical status of the patient has been investigated in children, 1-24 years old, with cystic fibrosis. No significant correlation was found between the amount of serum factor activity and age, clinical status assessed by the Schwachman score, pulmonary function (vital capacity, functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, residual volume, maximum breathing capacity, maximal midinspiratory flow, and maximal midexpiratory flow) or blood gas levels (pCO2, pO2). The activity showed no significant relationship to serum galactosyltransferase activity in children with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
