<TITLE>Use of a semi-synthetic amino acid, 3-methoxyphenyl-L-alanine to measure amino acid absorption. pp. 304-6.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>This paper describes investigations on the absorption of 3-methoxyphenyl-L-alanine (anisylalanine) in normal subjects, children with cystic fibrosis and in one child with Hartnup disease. Anisylalanine was slowly metabolised mainly to acetyl anisylalanine, and p-methoxyphenyl-pyruvic acid and lactic acids which were excreted. In normal adult subjects anisylalanine (25 mg/kg body weight) was rapidly absorbed, maximum plasma concentrations being obtained 0.5-1.0 hour after ingestion. Thereafter the plasma concentration declined exponentially. In the group of eight children with cystic fibrosis, the maximum plasma concentration was lower than observed in the control group, and was delayed. A very poor response was observed in an infant with Hartnup disorder.</ABSTRACT>
