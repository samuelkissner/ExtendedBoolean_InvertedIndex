<TITLE>Specific airway resistance from the perinatal period into adulthood. Alterations in childhood pulmonary disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Airway resistance and lung volume were measured by a modification of the plethysmographic method of Briscoe and DuBois (1) to calculate specific airway resistance (SRaw) on 263 control subjects ranging in age from the newborn to 54 years. the mean SRaw was lowest in the newborn period and increased rapidly to adult levels during the first years of life. In each age group, the mean SRaw was lower for females than it was for males. No control subject had an SRaw greater than 8 sec cm H2O. A decrease in mean SRaw from 4.2 sec cm H2O for females 5 to 9 years of age to 3.5 sec cm H2O for those over 18 years of age paralleled sexual maturation, but similar changes were not observed in the males. A direct correlation of SRaw with clinical observations was found in young patients with various degrees of pulmonary involvement because of cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
