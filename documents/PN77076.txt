<TITLE>Minimal bile acid malabsorption and normal bile acid breath tests in cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic insufficiency.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>This study was undertaken because of reports of a marked increase in fecal bile acid excretion by children with cystic fibrosis. We attempted to confirm this finding by performing [1-14C]cholylglycine breath tests and by measuring fecal bile acid and fat excretion in patients with cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic insufficiency. Studies were done when patients were taking pancreatic enzymes (Cotazym) and also without medication. 14CO2 excretion in breath was normal in patients with acquired pancreatic insufficiency and even lower in cystic fibrosis, both with and without Cotazym therapy. Fecal bile acid excretion was slightly elevated in both groups without Cotazym and became normal with Cotazym in patients with acquired pancreatic insufficiency. Steatorrhea was present in both patient groups and improved during Cotazym therapy. Bile acid malabsorption in cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic insufficiency is minimal and probably not clinically important.</ABSTRACT>
