<TITLE>Cystic fibrosis--related inhibition of mucociliary clearance in vivo in man.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Studies were performed to demonstrate possibly cystic fibrosis- related inhibition of mucociliary clearance in man. Topical application of normal serum or of CF serum did not inhibit in vivo nasal MCC. Induction of local inflammation by topical anti-IgE- reduced nasal MCC in CF subjects, but increased MCC in normal individuals. Furthermore, nasal MCC was inhibited in normal patients by CF serum but not normal serum, applied to the anti-IgE-treated nasal mucosa. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that CF serum inhibits MCC in vivo in the inflamed mucosa.</ABSTRACT>
