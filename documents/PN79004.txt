<TITLE>Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, small intestinal dysfunction and protein intolerance. A chance occurrence or a connection?.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The coexistence of cystic fibrosis (CF) and coeliac disease (CD) is reported in eight children, the odds against this occurring in the same child being 1:2 million to 1:5.9 million. In Sweden, it would be around 1:3 million (incidence of CF 1:3000 and of CD 1:1000). The coexistence of these two diseases is thought to be chance, although CF might predispose to the development of CD. In a 10-year period (with 33405 live births), we observed three children with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and small intestine dysfunction.</ABSTRACT>
