<TITLE>A placebo-controlled trial of cephalexin therapy in the ambulatory management of patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The effects of oral administration of cephalexin were evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 17 patients with mild to moderate pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis. For two years, four-month periods with cephalexin were alternated with four-month placebo periods. Thus, patients served as their own control subjects. Fungal vulvovaginitis occurred in two patients during cephalexin therapy. During the 2 years of study, the rate of colonization with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased and disease severity deteriorated in patients initially colonized with P. aeruginosa. Short-term courses of sputum culture-specific antibiotics improved the course of some patients with mild to moderate pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis. Treatment with cephalexin decreased the frequency of respiratory illnesses, respiratory illnesses requiring antibiotics, and hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses in patients initially colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Haemophilus influenzae, and also reduced colonization with these organisms. Improved weight gain in 16 of 17 patients was associated with periods of cephalexin therapy. Pulmonary function tests remained stable or improved in 10 or 14 patients. Disease severity improved in patients not colonized with P. aeruginosa.</ABSTRACT>
