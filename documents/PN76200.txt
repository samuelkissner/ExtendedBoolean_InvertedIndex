<TITLE>Carcinoembryonic antigen and cystic fibrosis protein in blood from cystic fibrosis homozygotes and heterozygote carriers.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) activity was measured by radioimmunoassay in blood from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes, heterozygote carriers of CF, normal healthy controls, and other patient controls with carcinomas involving gastrointestinal organs. All samples were also screened by electrofocusing for cystic fibrosis protein (CFP), a metabolic marker previously shown to be associated with the CF gene. Significantly increased levels of CEA activity were found in all CFP-positive groups; however, with one exception all patient controls with marked increases in CEA activity were CFP- negative. Immunodiffusion of perchloric acid extracts of CEA-like material from heterozygote carrier blood indicated that the CEA-like material, which was elevated in homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF, showed only partial identity with two separate CEA preparations obtained from colon carcinomas and was not identical to either A, B, or O(H) blood group substances. This glycoprotein material did, however, react with three different anti-CEA antisera. Our finding of an abnormally increased glycoprotein in cystic fibrosis, taken together with previous reports demonstrating abnormalities in the carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins found in various exocrine secretions in CF, further suggests that the primary defect in this disease is manifested partly as a defect in glycoprotein metabolism. This defect may result from an abnormality in one or more of the glycosyltransferases, possibly caused by a more primary defect in polyamine metabolism.</ABSTRACT>
