<TITLE>Ultramicro-electrophoresis of protein in sweat from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas and controls.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>46 sweat-samples from 32 children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (C.F.) and 35 samples from 23 control-children were collected with glass micro-capillaries. Protein was determined by ultramicro-electrophoresis. Results: 1. Protein was detected in 48% of the samples (C.F. and controls). 2. At pH 2.3, C.F.-sweat showed at least one more band than control-sweat. 3. At pH 8.9, C.F.-sweat occasionally showed one more band than the control-group. 4. At pH 2.3, more protein was found at the electrophoresis start point using C.F.-sweat, whereas at pH 8.9 the opposite was found. 5. At pH 2.3, protein was found in fewer samples than at pH 8.9. The "C.F.-factor" is postulated to represent a basic polyelectrolyte which induces the following pathogenic mechanisms: a) Aggregation of proteins giving rise to a high viscosity of secretions, such as saliva. b) Binding to the cell-membrane of the glandular epithelium, thus inducing a disturbance of active NaCl-reabsorption (e.g. by reduction of luminal passive Na+-influx).</ABSTRACT>
