<TITLE>Efficiency of two pancreatic extracts in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Nitrogen- and lipid absorption coefficients were studied in 62 patients with cystic fibrosis, aged 2/12 to 12 years, and compared with the results obtained in 20 normal children. In 59 of the 62 patients nitrogen- and lipid absorption were grossly abnormal. Age-linked differences were not found. The efficacy of two pancreatic enzymes preparations was found to be similar. Both preparations produced the same significant improvement in the absorption of proteins and lipids.</ABSTRACT>
