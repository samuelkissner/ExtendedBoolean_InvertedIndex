<TITLE>Endoscopic pancreatography: an analysis of the radiologic findings in pancreatitis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The endoscopic pancreaticographic findings in 46 proved cases of pancreatitis are analyzed. Pathologic ductograms were demonstrated in approximately 60%. Significant information was obtained in many cases, allowing both proper diagnosis of the primary disease process and complications thereof. Because of the latter, the procedure has proved to be quite helpful in isolating those patients who could benefit from surgery.</ABSTRACT>
