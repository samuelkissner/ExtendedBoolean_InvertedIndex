<TITLE>Nasal polyps in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In II polyps from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, the density, shape, and architecture of mucous glands were studied by the whole-mount method and compared with 102 non-cystic-fibrosis polyps. There were no differences in density which was in most polyps less than 0.5 gland/mm.2. The shape and architecture as well as other histological appearances of the polyp were also alike in both groups of polyps which could not be distinguished. The pathogenesis of nasal polyps in cystic fibrosis is discussed. Apparently, it is the same as that of non-cystic-fibrosis polyps.</ABSTRACT>
