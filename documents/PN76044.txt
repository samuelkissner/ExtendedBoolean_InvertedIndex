<TITLE>The transformation by simian virus 40 of cells from patients with mucopolysaccharidosis and from normal controls.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Fibroblasts derived from individuals with mucopolysaccharidosis, an inborn error of metabolism, have been found to be more easily transformed by simian virus 40 than are cells derived from normal individuals. The increased susceptibility does not seem to depend upon changes in glycoprotein at the cell surface. Repeated observations were necessary to demonstrate these differences, and we do not believe that this test is suitable for routine screening for cancer susceptibility.</ABSTRACT>
