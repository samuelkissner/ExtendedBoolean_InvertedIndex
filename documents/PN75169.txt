<TITLE>Studies on immunoglobulins in healthy children in various stages of development and in the chosen illnesses.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The studies were carried out with view to evaluate development of immunoglobulins biosynthesis in children from birth through first year of life and up to age of 15 years as well as to establish the normal values of each immunoglobulin class in healthy children of different age in our conditions of investigations and in our geografical, social and economical situation. There was also under consideration the evaluation of body reaction on antigenic stimulation and administration of gammaglobulin preparations. In order to determine more broadly the development of these humoral immunity parameters in children qualitative and quantitative investigations of immunoglobulins were undertaken also in same chosen illnesses where changes in biosynthesis and metabolism of immunoglobulins may be connected with pathogenesis of illness or with type of treatment (cystic fibrosis) (C.F.), Ataxia-Telangiectasia syndrome (A-T), pituitary dwarfism, fenyloketonuria (PKU). In some groups of children investigations were systematically repeated to evaluate the dynamism of changes.</ABSTRACT>
