<TITLE>Plasma membrane components of skin fibroblasts from normal individuals and patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Plasma membranes have been isolated without proteolytic modification from fibroblast lines derived from patients with CF, from heterozygous parents, and from normal children. The cells had been grown in the presence of 3H- OR 14C- labeled L-leucine, D- glucosamine, and L-fucose. Membranes were mixed in suitable combinations to allow comparisons to be made between the different cell types. No differences in the plasma membrane composition, as revealed by divergence in 3H- or 14C-profiles, could be detected after gel electrophoresis. Identical protein and glycoprotein components were present in approximately similar amounts in all groups of cells;</ABSTRACT>
