<TITLE>Symptomatic hepatic disease in cystic fibrosis: incidence, course, and outcome of portal systemic hunting.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Fifteen (2.2%) of 693 patients with cystic fibrosis seen over an 18- year period developed clinical hepatic disease. In 13 patients all symptoms were secondary to portal hypertension. Ten had hypersplenism and 6 had variceal bleeding, including 3 who developed both conditions. All 5 patients who survived the initial episode of gastrointestinal bleeding underwent portal systemic shunting. A shunting procedure also was performed on 1 patients with hypersplenism but no variceal bleeding. No subsequent deterioration of intellectual function occurred in either the shunted or unshunted patients. Only 1 of the shunted patients showed progression of hepatic disease after surgery. These results suggest that portal systemic shunting is useful in the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices in cystic fibrosis. A sweat test to rule out cystic fibrosis should be included in the evaluation of any teenage or young adult patient with unexplained portal hypertension.</ABSTRACT>
