<TITLE>Activity of serum alpha-amylases in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A new method which uses a differential inhibitor to measure pancreatic and salivary type alpha-amylases (EC 3.2.1.1) was applied to serum samples from 46 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (age range 4- 14 years) and 50 controls of the same age group. The levels of pancreatic type amylase were lower in the CF patients (median 26.5 I.U./1) than the controls (median 81.5) (P less than 0.001). The results for salivary-type enzyme, however, did not support the previously reported finding of higher than usual levels in CF patients. This discrepancy is probably due to differences in analytical methods. It is felt that this procedure will be of value in the investigation of patients for cystic fibrosis and other pancreatic disorders.</ABSTRACT>
