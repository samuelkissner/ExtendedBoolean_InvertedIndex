<TITLE>Sensitive trypsin assay for dried-blood specimens as a screening procedure for early detection of cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>An immunoreactive-trypsin assay uses small dried-blood spots (diameter 1.25 mm) and is therefore suitable for incorporation in established neonatal screening schemes. Blood specimens from neonates with cystic fibrosis had trypsin levels greater than those in control subjects, thus confirming earlier findings. Trypsin levels were below normal in several older patients with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
