<TITLE>Proteolytic activity in duodenal juice in infants, children, and adults.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The capacity of duodenal juice to hydrolyse casein to trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides was investigated: in a control group (11 infants and children and 7 adults); in 5 children with pancreatic disease; in 10 children with enterogenic malabsorption (coeliac disease and cow's milk protein intolerance). The proteolytic activity per ml duodenal juice in fasting condition was as great in healthy infants and children as healthy adults (500-600 mg casein/ml/hour). There was a good correlation between trypsin content and proteolytic activity of duodenal juice. In pancreatic insufficiency, the proteolytic activity was extremely low (not measurable in 3 patients) as was the trypsin activity whereas in enterogenic malabsorption, it was within the ranges of the controls.</ABSTRACT>
