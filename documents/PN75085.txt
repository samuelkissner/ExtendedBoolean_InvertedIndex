<TITLE>Clinical aspects of iron absorption and turnover. pp. 34-61.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The diagnostic 10 micro-mole (0.56 mg) 59Fe2 absorption whole body retention test (Fig. 1) has now been in use for 10 years for the detection of depleted iron stores in subjects with iron deficiency (Heinrich et al., 1966; Heinrich and Bartels, 1967). Further studies were necessary to investigate the clinical reliability of increased 59Fe2 absorption in patients with erythroblastic hyperplasia, which may control the regulation of iron absorption by iron stores. The relationship between iron absorption and iron stores was studied in pancreatic insufficiency to reinvestigate the effect of pancreatic secretion on iron absorption. Iron absorption in patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy was investigated in order to correlate the impairment of iron absorption with the degree of villous atrophy and to study its recovery on a gluten-free diet. Dietary iron absorption was measured in patients with gastric mucosal atrophy and partial gastrectomy to investigate the extent to which iron malabsorption is responsible for the high incidence of iron deficiency in such patients. The combination of the diagnostic 59Fe2 absorption test and measurement of the whole body 59Fe2 elimination rate is a useful routine procedure for the detection and quantification of gastrointestinal or urogenital blood loss as a cause of iron deficiency.</ABSTRACT>
