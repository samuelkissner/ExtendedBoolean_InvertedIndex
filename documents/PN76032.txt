<TITLE>Assessing obstructive airways disease in children. Which test is best?.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Tests for airways obstruction based on a forced expiration were carried out in 60 children with asthma and 15 with cystic fibrosis to determine which test or tests were the best in identifying children with airways disease, to determine the severity of disease and to document response to therapy. Maximum expiratory flow, measured from a maximum expiratory flow volume curve, and maximum mid-expiratory flow measured from a spirogram, were the most sensitive tests in detecting early disease. Maximum expiratory flow measured from the maximum expiratory flow volume curve, combined with measurement of lung volumes, gave the best overall estimate of severity. Peak expiratory flow rate measured with a Peak Flow Meter, because of its simplicity of measurement, was the most useful test for routine use in the clinic and consulting room to monitor severity and response to therapy.</ABSTRACT>
