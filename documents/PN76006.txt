<TITLE>The adrenal cortex in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The morphologies of the adrenal cortical zones of 25 children with cystic fibrosis and 24 control patients are presented. A technic for objective measurement of these zones is described. Hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa in the children with cystic fibrosis is significant and may be related to chronic loss of salt in the sweat or demands placed on renal salt-conserving mechanisms.</ABSTRACT>
