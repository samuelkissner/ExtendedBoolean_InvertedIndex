<TITLE>An electron microscopic cytochemical study on concanavalin A binding sites and their mobility in normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts in vitro.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Concanavalin A (Con A) binding sites were visualized ultrastructurally in the cultured fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients, obligatory heterozygotes, and normal individuals by peroxidase labeling technique. Con A binding sites were localized as a continuous layer on the external side of the plasma membrane in fixed fibroblasts of the three genotypes. In living cells, Con A induces both lateral and vertical movements of binding sites as expressed by cap formation and internalization of the plasma membrane. Fibroblasts of the three genotypes responded similarly to Con A treatment and failed to show significant detectable differences.</ABSTRACT>
