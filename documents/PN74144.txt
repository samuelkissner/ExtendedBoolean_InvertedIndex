<TITLE>The methylation of transfer and ribosomal ribonucleic acid in human fibroblasts: normal methylation of ribonucleic acid in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A comprehensive study of tRNA and 18 S and 28 S rRNA methylation in human fibroblasts is presented. Cells from normal volunteers and patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were examined during exponential growth by incubation with L-(methyl-14C)methionine and (3H)uridine. The ratio of 14C to 3H counts per minute in isolated RNA serves as a measure of the extent of methylation and was found to be similar in normal and CF fibroblasts for tRNA, 18 S rRNA, and 28 S rRNA. Hydrolyzed samples of (14C)-methyl-labeled RNA species were analyzed by two dimensional chromatography and autoradiography. The methylated base and nucleoside compositions of tRNA and rRNA agree well with data for HeLa cells and other eurkaryote cells such as those from yeast, mouse, and chicken. RNA methylation patterns in CF fibroblasts were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed in normal cells for 4 S, 18 S, and 28 S RNA. There is no evidence that RNA species from patients with cystic fibrosis are deficient in any methylated components. Methylation of RNA by tissue-cultured cells from cystic fibrosis is qualitatively and quantitatively normal and will not prove to be a useful marker for identification of carriers of cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
