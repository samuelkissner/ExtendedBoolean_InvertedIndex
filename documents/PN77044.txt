<TITLE>Bronchial asthma due to allergy to pancreatic extract: a hazard in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The mother of two children suffering from cystic fibrosis developed marked allergic symptoms affecting the eyes, nose and bronchi and severe bronchial asthma ensued. The cause of this allergy proved to be the powder released on opening the capsules of pancreatic extract which she provided for her children at each mealtime. The risk of pancreatic extract to those handling it, and possibly also to patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, is emphasized.</ABSTRACT>
