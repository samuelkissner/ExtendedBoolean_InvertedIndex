<TITLE>Urinary cyclic nucleotides in adult male cystic fibrosis patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Urinary adenosine 3':5' (cyclic) monophosphate and guanosine 3':5' (cyclic)-monophosphate excretion are significantly elevated in adult male cystic fibrosis patients compared to normal men when values are expressed in ways which consider the smaller size of the cystic fibrosis subjects of the same age. Cystic fibrosis patients excreted 3.22 +/- 1.16 nmol adenosine 3':5' (cyclic)monophosphate/g creatinine per 24 h vs. 1.97 +/- 0.43 for normal men (p less than 0.02); and cystic fibrosis patients excreted 0.50 +/- 0.16 nmol guanosine 3':k' (cyclic)monophosphate/g creatinine per 24 h vs. 0.30 +/- 0.07 for normal men (p less than 0.05). Subjects were all adults who had completed linear growth and sexual development, thus eliminating any possible effects of slower maturation of cystic fibrosis patients, and all subjects were male, thus avoiding the fluctuation of urinary cyclic nucleotides with the menstrual cycle, problems which had complicated interpretation of previous studies.</ABSTRACT>
