<TITLE>Differential serum amylase determination by use of an inhibitor, and design of a routine procedure.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>We describe a new method for measuring pancreatic and salivary-type amylases in serum that requires no electrophoresis or chromatography. An inhibitor protein (from wheat) with a 100-fold greater specificity for human salivary than for human pancreatic amylase was used to analyze mixtures of the two enzymes. The concentration of pancreatic and salivary amyalase was determined in 141 normal sera (72 men and 69 women). Statistically significant differences were found for serum pancreatic amylase between mean and women, higher values being shown in women. No sex-related difference was found for the salivary component of serum amylase. With this method, the increase in serum amylase activity in pancreatitis was shown to be attributable to the pancreatic component. In mumps, the increase is attributable to the salivary component. In pancreatic insufficiency, serum pancreatic amylase activities were significantly lower than in the controls. Our method is simple and rapid; our results agree well with those of other authors who used chromatographic or electrophoretic methods.</ABSTRACT>
