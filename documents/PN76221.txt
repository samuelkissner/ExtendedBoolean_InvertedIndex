<TITLE>Immunochemical studies of the plasma and cultured fibroblast media fractions containing the cystic fibrosis ciliary inhibitor.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The cystic fibrosis ciliary inhibitor (CFCI) has been fractionated from plasma of cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and from the media of cultured fibroblasts derived from CF homozygotes. Plasma and fibroblast media from normal controls have been fractionated in an identical manner. Fractions from plasma and fibroblast culture media that demonstrate ciliary inhibitory activity contain several proteins in a molecular weight range of approximately 5,000-11,000. These proteins have been partially characterized by immunochemical analysis with antisera to 33 human serum proteins. Immunological determinants of albumin, C3 (but not C3a), C4, C5, alpha1-lipoprotein, beta- lipoprotein, beta2-microglobulin and immunoglobulin light chains have been detected by hemagglutination in fractions of CF plasma that inhibited ciliary activity and in analogous fractions from normal sera. None of the proteins were detected in media of cultured fibroblasts from either genotype. Since the same proteins and protein fragments were identified in both CF and normal plasma fractions, and were not detected in CF fibroblast media, it appears that none of these proteins can be identified as the CFCI. Identification of these proteins will permit further purification of the CFCI by immunochemical methods.</ABSTRACT>
