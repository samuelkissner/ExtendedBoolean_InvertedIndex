<TITLE>Membrane function in cystic fibrosis. I. Putrescine transport in normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Putrescine transport was examined in normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts. No differences were observed in accumulation pattern, kinetics of uptake, or efflux between CF and normal cells. In both growing and growth-arrested CF and normal fibroblasts, exogenously supplied putrescine remained unchanged for at least 60 min. Some differences were observed in the response of CF and normal cells to environmental (media) changes.</ABSTRACT>
