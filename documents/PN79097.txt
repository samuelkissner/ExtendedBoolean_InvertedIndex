<TITLE>Defective cellular immunity to gram-negative bacteria in cystic fibrosis patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In vitro lymphocyte responses to Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been found to be impaired in cystic fibrosis patients with advanced clinical disease. The responses to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis were studied in a similar group of cystic fibrosis patients and normal individuals. Cystic fibrosis patients found to be unresponsive to pseudomonas were also unresponsive to klebsiella, serratia, and proteus. Responsiveness to Staphylococcus aureus was not impaired in cystic fibrosis patients. We postulate that in vitro lymphocyte responses to several gram- negative bacteria require the function of a lymphocyte subpopulation which may be impaired in some cystic fibrosis patients.</ABSTRACT>
