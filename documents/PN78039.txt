<TITLE>Activity of serum inhibitory proteases in bronchial secretions from children with various chronic non-specific respiratory diseases.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In a group of 223 children with various chronic, non-specific respiratory diseases, the levels of serum inhibitory proteolytic enzymes in bronchial secretions was measured. Activity of inhibitory proteolytic enzymes was analyzed according to the nature of bronchial lesions observed at bronchoscopy and character and cellular composition of bronchial secretion. Statistically significant increase of the mean inhibitory value in comparison to values in the control group, was found in children with recurrent bronchitis (a-1- AT), cystic fibrosis (a-1-AT and a-1-X), chronic bronchitis (a-1-X), bronchiectases (a-1-X) and in children with obstructive bronchitis (a- 2-M).</ABSTRACT>
