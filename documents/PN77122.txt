<TITLE>Management of pneumothorax in children with chronic pulmonary disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Cystic fibrosis is the most common form of chronic pulmonary disease in the pediatric age group. As these children survive longer with improved therapy, the incidence of pneumothorax has increased. In our patients who were more than 10 years of age, the incidence of pneumothorax was 12.5 percent. We have reviewed the records of 22 patients who have had 44 episodes of pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis. In addition, our experience includes one child with histiocytosis in whom pneumothorax was a serious complication. One other pneumothorax occurred in a teen-age girl with apical bullous disease. A child who presents with even a minimal pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis is at considerable risk of developing an increasing lung collapse. Even if the pneumothorax resolves, there is a high risk of recurrence. In children treated with only a chest tube there was a 50 percent recurrence. Consequently, we recommend a chest tube for any episode of pneumothorax in a child with cystic fibrosis, with installation of a sclerosing agent when the lung expands. Three of our patients so treated had no recurrence. Children who have a persistent air leak are confined to bed, retain secretions, and pursue a rapid downhill course. A more aggressive approach to these children, consisting of thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, pteural symphysis, and pulmonary lavage is feasible and the mortality rate is low. A pneumothorax in a child with no evidence of cystic fibrosis is a rare event. A persistent air leak is an indication for thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, and lung biopsy. Histiocytosis X is one rare cause for this complication in children.</ABSTRACT>
