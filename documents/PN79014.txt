<TITLE>Serum glycine-conjugated bile acids in pediatric hepatobiliary disorders.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Measurements of serum bile acids (glycine conjugates of cholic, chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and lithocholic acids) by radioimmunoassay in a variety of pediatric hepatobiliary disorders showed elevations in neonatal hepatitis syndromes, cholestasis, and hepatitis of extrahepatic or intrahepatic origin. Measurements of individual serum bile acids failed to differentiate between the various neonatal hepatitis syndromes. In one patient with cholestasis, the increased levels of bile acids observed returned to normal following therapy with cholestyramine and phenobarbital. In chronic active hepatitis the serum bile acid values correlated well with the bilirubin and SGOT in response to therapy with corticosteroids. These data confirm suggestions that serum cholylglycine and chenodeoxycholylglycine levels are a sensitive indicator of disturbed hepatic function and can be used in monitoring the course, activity, and therapeutic response in various hepatitis syndromes. In Reye's syndrome and protracted diarrhea of infancy, elevations in serum bile acids were detected without associated hyperbilirubinemia and provided additional evidence of disturbed hepatic function.</ABSTRACT>
