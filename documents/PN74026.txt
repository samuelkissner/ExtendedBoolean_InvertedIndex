<TITLE>Plasma arginine esterase activity in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Plasma arginine esterase activity was measured in 13 young adult patients with cystic fibrosis and in 36 control subjects. The enzyme was activated by treating the plasma with chloroform and ellagic acid in the manner described by Rao and associates (1). No difference was found either between the arginine esterase activities of the patients with cystic fibrosis and the control subjects, or between the degrees of activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Thus, the findings of Rao and associates of a deficiency of arginine esterase activity in the plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis were not confirmed.</ABSTRACT>
