<TITLE>Membrane fluidity in normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>We have observed distinct differences in the polarization of fluorescence and temperature dependent emission intensity of the highly fluoescent phospholipid derivative (1-acyl-2-(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)--aminocaproyl phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC), when incorporated in the plasma membranes of normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts. Fluorescence polarization measurements indicate that the fluorochrome has a much higher degree of rotational mobility in cystic fibrosis fibroblasts as compared with normal cells. Temperature dependent transitions in the emission intensity of NBD-PC incorporated in normal fibroblasts are indicated at 17.7 and 21.2 degrees C while the abnormal cell membranes apparently undergo transitions at 8.7 and 13.5 degrees C. These differences might be due to changes in plasma membrane composition and/or organization, in the case of the cystic fibrosis cells.</ABSTRACT>
