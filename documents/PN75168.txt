<TITLE>Screening for the early detection of diseases in Great Britain.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>An account is given of screening for the early detection of disease in Great Britain today. The organisation of screening programmes provided nationally for the whole population is described. These include programmes for prenatal care, screening of infants, screening of schoolchildren, and screening of women for carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix. Selective screening programmes for tuberculosis and for various industrial diseases are mentioned. Experience in provision of these services on a national scale has emphasised the importance of evaluating future screening programmes, before they are implemented, by research studies on their effectiveness, their possibly harmful side effects, and their cost. Evidence from research in screening for a number of diseases is very briefly summarized, and it is concluded that there may be some development of programmes for the early detection and treatment of hypertension and of breast cancer, but for other diseases and for multiphasic screening, evidence so far available is insufficient to warrant any immediate extension from research towards service.</ABSTRACT>
