<TITLE>Differential incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA in cultured skin fibroblasts derived from patients with cystic fibrosis and controls.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR) incorporation into DNA of the fibroblasts derived from subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their controls was studied with scintillation counting and autoradiography. 3H-TdR incorporation at 24 hours postseeding was significantly less (p &lt; 0.005) in CF strains in comparison with cells from controls. The percentage of labeled fibroblasts was not significantly difference between the two strains (p &gt; 0.1). The cell cycle time and the duration of each phase were studied by a mitotic selection and scintillation counting technique. There was no difference in cell cycle time between CF and control fibroblasts, however, the duration of the synthetic phase was significantly (p &lt; 0.005) longer in CF subjects.</ABSTRACT>
