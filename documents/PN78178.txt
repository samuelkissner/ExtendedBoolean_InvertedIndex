<TITLE>Effect of saliva from cystic fibrosis patients and from normal subjects on red blood cell sodium transport.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Saliva, whether taken from patients with cystic fibrosis or from normal subjects, caused an increase in red blood cell Na+ efflux (in the presence or absence of ouabain) of 19-29% as compared with non- saliva controls. However, there was no significant difference between the effects of cystic fibrosis saliva and normal saliva.</ABSTRACT>
