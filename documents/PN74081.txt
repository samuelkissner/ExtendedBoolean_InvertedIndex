<TITLE>Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and humoral antibody response of patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Study of the humoral antibody response of patients with cystic fibrosis to the heat-stable O (and possibly K) antigens of Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed that these antibodies in significant titers do not lead to eradication of the microorganism from the respiratory tract. In three out of six patients, antibodies directed against the strains isolated from both sputum and the lungs at autopsy were present in elevated titers. The antibody response to P. aeruginosa is strikingly affected by the condition of the host and differs in patients with cystic fibrosis or with one or another kind of malignancy.</ABSTRACT>
