<TITLE>Chemotherapy of chronic infections with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa in lower airways of patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The bacteriological effect of chemotherapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ps.ae.) in lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis is reviewed. During a 5-year period 49 children and adults were treated with 190 courses of different antibiotics. The mucoid strains of Ps.ae. disappeared in 72.0% of the courses in which a combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin was employed. Tobramycin given alone had only bacteriological effect in 26.6% of the courses. Colimycin alone or in combination with carbenicillin had no effect. In 18 patients who received subsequent courses of tobramycin and combination of tobramycin and carbenicillin a significant difference in favour of the combination therapy was found, also in cases with many precipitins against Ps.ae. in serum. In 74.5% of the initially successful courses the patients were recolonized with Ps.ae. within 1 month. No nephrotoxic or ototoxic side effects were demonstrated in spite of the high doses of tobramycin (10 mg/kg/24 h) emmployed and the repeated courses.</ABSTRACT>
