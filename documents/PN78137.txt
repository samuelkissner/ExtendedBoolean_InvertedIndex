<TITLE>IgE antibody production to exoenzymes and common antigen (OEP) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>IgE antibody production to exoenzymes and common antigen (OEP) of P. aeruginosa was studied in mice that were injected with the antigens incorporated into water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsion or Al(OH)3 gel. OEP and protease toxoid (PT) elicited IgE antibody response but elastase toxoid (ET) did not. Capacity of the OEP to produce IgE antibody was reduced remarkably by it's protease treatment, which suggested that the capacity lies in the protein portion of OEP. The w/o/w emulsion was less effective than Al(OH)3 gel in adjuvanticity to elicit IgE antibody response, but the emulsion enhanced the IgM and/or IgG antibody response to PT and maintained a constant level for a long period. These findings may suggest that IgE antibody response to some components of P. aeruginosa could be induced in man. High serum level of IgE was observed in some cases of cystic fibrosis caused by P. aeruginosa infection, although the IgE antibody activity has not yet been determined.</ABSTRACT>
