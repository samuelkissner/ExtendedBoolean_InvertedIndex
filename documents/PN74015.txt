<TITLE>Polypoid cervicitis in cystic fibrosis patients receiving oral contraceptives.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Three of the 4 women in a cystic fibrosis clinic who used a combined form of oral contraceptive developed acute polypoid cervicitis. In one woman, the polyp recurred on reinstitution of the medication. There was resolution of the polyp in each instance on discontinuation of the drugs. In 2 of the 3 affected women, there was coincidental deterioration of respiratory status. Therefore, it is suggested that cystic fibrosis patients who are using oral contraception be observed closely regarding pulmonary and gynecologic status.</ABSTRACT>
