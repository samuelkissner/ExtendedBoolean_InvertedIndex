<TITLE>Nonoperative treatment of meconium ileus equivalent.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Intraluminal bowel obstruction secondary to inspissated feces is a known complication of cystic fibrosis. When seen in the older child, it is termed "meconium ileus equivalent." We studied a case in which nonsurgical resolution of the obstruction was obtained with N- acetylcysteine enemas and pancreatic replacement enzymes given orally and by enema. The pathogenesis of this disorder and the basis for the treatment are described. Recognition of this complication and familiarity with its medical management are important in caring for the older child with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
