<TITLE>Intracisternal inclusion bodies induced in animals: their transformation and significance.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Intracisternal granules (Palade, 1956) or inclusion bodies occurring within the cisternae of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum have been observed not only in normal conditions, but also in some experimental conditions. In this paper, such intracisternal inclusion bodies were induced or found in a variety of animals following chemical administrations, artificial hibernation and cold exposure, and also with cystic fibrosis. These inclusion bodies are tentatively classified into 6 types based upon their morphological aspects. The formation, fate and significance of these bodies are also discussed.</ABSTRACT>
