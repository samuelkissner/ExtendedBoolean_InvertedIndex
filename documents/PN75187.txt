<TITLE>Obscure bilateral calcified swellings of paratesticular tissues.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A case of calcified swellings of the paratesticular tissues discovered in an infant at different ages is described. The exact cause is obscure; and three pathologic conditions are suggested. Possibly it was due to an old reaction to meconium peritonitis through a patent processus vaginalis.</ABSTRACT>
