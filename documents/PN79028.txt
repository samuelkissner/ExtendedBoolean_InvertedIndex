<TITLE>Radioimmunoassay of trypsin. A new aid in the assessment of pancreatic function.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>This review describes the development and application of a novel test to determine levels of human immunoreactive trypsin, an enzyme produced solely by the pancreas, in biological fluids. Being organ- specific, the assay of immunoreactive trypsin should be an ideal marker of pancreatic function, and this is supported by the results of a number of clinical and research investigations. Use of this assay in studies of chronic pancreatitis, juvenile-onset diabetes, and cystic fibrosis has yielded much valuable data, and it is expected that further research will lead to an improved understanding of these and other conditions associated with the pancreas in health and disease.</ABSTRACT>
