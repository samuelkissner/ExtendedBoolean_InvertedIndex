<TITLE>Volume-controlled lung lavage in a woman with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>A 22-year-old woman with cystic fibrosis was treated by volume- controlled lavage of each of her lungs on two occasions. Following the first lavages, the patient's vital capacity increased by 1.03 liters and her 1-sec forced expiratory volume increased by 0.70 liters/second. Similar improvements, although less pronounced, were noted after both lungs has been lavaged a second time. It is concluded that volume-controlled lung lavage can be of benefit as an adjunct in the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
