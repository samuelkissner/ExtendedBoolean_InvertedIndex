<TITLE>Glycosidases in serum of cystic fibrosis patients.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In a study of eight glycosidases in serum samples from 72 cystic fibrosis patients, 85 cystic fibrosis parents and 34 healthy and diseased controls, significant elevations of mean alpha-glucosidase levels were found in cystic fibrosis patients. All other glycosidases did not show any significant change. Mean alpha-glucosidase levels in obligate heterozygotes were the same as in control individuals. Moreover, alpha-glucosidase levels in cystic fibrosis patients correlated with the degree of clinical impairment as measured by the Schwachman score.</ABSTRACT>
