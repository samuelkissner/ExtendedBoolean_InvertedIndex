<TITLE>HL-A antigens in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>HL-A frequencies of 28 patients with cystic fibrosis and of 240 unrelated controls were compared. No statistically significant difference of HL-A frequencies could be observed for both groups. A slightly increased HL-A 2 frequency is considered a chance phenomenon. In accordance with a previously demonstrated lacking association of the ABH blood group substances no correlation with certain HL-A antigens was demonstrable.</ABSTRACT>
