<TITLE>Otorhinolaryngologic complications of cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Inasmuch as cystic fibrosis is a generalized exocrinopathy and affects all the mucous glands in the body, the complications of this disease involving the ear, nose, and throat are obviously protean. This presentation includes a discussion of chronic ear infections relative to the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, a discussion of nasal polyps and their treatment, salivary gland involvement in cystic fibrosis, and the results of sialography. The effects of respiratory therapy upon the upper respiratory tract and the problems of general anesthesia in patients who undergo surgical procedures are also discussed.</ABSTRACT>
