<TITLE>Lung function in children and young adults with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The main characteristic of patients with cystic fibrosis is lung involvement; the fatal outcome of the disease is most often due to pulmonary complications. Since the paper by West et al. (1954) on pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis, the importance of lung function studies in this disorder has been stressed in several publications. We have studied lung function in a number of children and young adults with cystic fibrosis. The results have been correlated with clinical, radiological, and bacteriological findings.</ABSTRACT>
