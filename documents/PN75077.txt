<TITLE>Classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia in cystic fibrosis correlated with growth parameters.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Metachromasia of cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and the assignment of the fibroblasts to one of three classes after the morphological distribution of the metachromatic staining, have been described by Danes and Bearn (1968, 1969) and Danes (1969). In two previous studies from this hospital (Lykkegaard & Jacobsen 1975, Lykkegaard & Thuesen Pedersen 1975) the clinical, radiological, and functional severity of the lung disease and the serum protein pattern in CF patients were studied in relation to classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia. It was found that class III patients tended to be more severely affected than class II patients, and more than class I + II patients, and, possibly, class I patients were also more severely affected than class II patients. Sproul and Huang (1964), in a study of growth patterns in cystic fibrosis, found a significant correlation between severity of the respiratory disease and height and weight retardation. In the present study, height and weight development in 98 CF patients are correlated with class of skin fibroblast metachromasia.</ABSTRACT>
