<TITLE>Peliosis hepatis in a child.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Peliosis hepatis, which has previously only been reported in adults, occurred in a chronically ill 11-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis. As in cases in adults, chronic illness, long-term anabolic steroid therapy, and right ventricular congestive failure may well have been the causative factors in this case. Histologically, the phlebectatic and parenchymal types, which were presumed to be separate, were found conjointly in this case. This is compatible with its origin from severe right ventricular congestive failure. The rarity of peliosis, however, indicates that one or more as yet unknown factors might be operative in its development.</ABSTRACT>
