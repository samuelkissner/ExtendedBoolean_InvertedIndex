<TITLE>Mucopolysaccharides in bronchial secretion of children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The diseases of respiratory system are nowadays one of the important medical, economical and social problems of modern civilization. A common symptom of these diseases regardless of their etiology, character, klinical manifestation and morphological findings is hypersecretion of bronchial sputum. Tracheobronchial mucus is produced by mucous bronchial glands and goblet cells. This mucus represents at physiological condition about 5 micrometer thick cover on mucous of nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi up to terminal bronchioles. Protective function of mucus cover resposes in mechanical and humoral barrier and also in removing the inhaled particles and their transport to the upper part of the respiratory system. In spite of the fact, that bronchial secretion has an important role in protective mechanism and in thermal and water exchange of respiratory tract, this secretion is not sufficiently scrutinized mainly of children yet.</ABSTRACT>
