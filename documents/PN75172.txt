<TITLE>Decreased inhibition of platelet aggregation by PGE1 in children with cystic fibrosis and their parents.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>PGE1 inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in children with cystic fibrosis and their parents to a much lesser extent than in normal controls. We suggest that this may be a reliable test for heterozygote carriers of cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
