<TITLE>Intractable diarrhoea of infancy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The intractable diarrhoea syndrome of infancy continues to be a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the paediatrician and paediatric gastroenterologist. A carefully organized, staged approach to diagnosis will provide the best method of identifying those infants in whom a specific aetiology exists and for whom specific therapy is often available. Regardless of aetiology, however, the early use of appropriate nutritional support will not only reduce morbidity and mortality in these infants, but will prevent the development of many of the secondary consequences of malnutrition. The physician must compulsively pay attention to the details of daily management and provide an organized approach to diagnosis and treatment in order to improve the outcome of infants with intractable diarrhoea.</ABSTRACT>
