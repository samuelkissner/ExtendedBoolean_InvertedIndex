<TITLE>Cystic fibrosis in adolescents and young adults.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>With the early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and the better management of these patients in childhood increasing numbers are surviving to adult life. The main problem requiring continuous medical care in the older cystic fibrosis patient is persisting and often progressive chest disease. For this reason the cystic fibrosis clinic for adolescents and young adults was started in the Western Infirmary in 1975. This paper presents our observations on 13 patients who had attended between 1975 and 1977. Eleven patients are alive and well and have shown no evidence of deterioration over this period. Ten are at school or in regular employment. With optimum medical supervision it is possible to give young adults with cystic fibrosis a worthwhile existence.</ABSTRACT>
