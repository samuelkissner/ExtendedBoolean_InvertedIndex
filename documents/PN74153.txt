<TITLE>Gentamicin in paediatrics.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Gentamicin is a broad-spectrum, bactericidal aminoglycoside antibiotic in its tenth year of use in the U.K. League tables of antibiotics, ranked by disc sensitivity tests against urinary tract pathogens and Staph. aureus confirm its remarkable effectiveness in 1973. Bacteriodes sp. and some streptococci are the only major omissions from its spectrum. MIC of sensitive strains is usually less than or equal to 2 microg/ml although Pseudomonas may require greater than or equal to 4 microg/ml. The therapeutic range aimed for is 2-12 microg/ml in serum and peak levels are measured 1 hr after intramuscular and 20 min after intravenous injection. Most workers regard a level of 12 microg/ml as potentially toxic and try to avoid exceeding it.</ABSTRACT>
