<TITLE>Dietary problems associated with the care of chronically sick children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The dietary problems associated with the care of chronically sick children can be considered under two broad headings. First, there are the problems in those children for whom diet is an essential part of the treatment of their chronic disorder; and second there are nutritional complications which may occur in children with chronic diseases in which diet does not have a specific role in treatment, and is thus often neglected or considered only at a later stage of management. Many of the problems are of course common to both situations. This paper will review briefly some of the difficulties, illustrating these with specific examples; no attempt will be made to describe or discuss the treatment of any particular disorder.</ABSTRACT>
