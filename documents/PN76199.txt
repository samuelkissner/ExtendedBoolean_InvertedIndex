<ABSTRACT>To date, most cases of cystic fibrosis have been treated in pediatric hospitals. With changes and advances in treatment, patients who were once considered terminally ill are now living into adulthood. The stresses that result from chronic illness are considered herein from the standpoint of the social caseworker, who plans a crucial role on the patient-care team. New problems regarding the personal development of the patient are presented, with particular emphasis on the role of a CF patient as a parent. The role of the respiratory therapist in the care of such patients is unique. This is due to the extensiveness of patient contact, both verbal and physical, and to the primary threat that pulmonary disease poses to the patient with CF. The therapist's ability to cope with the problem, while aiding the family and patient to do the same, becomes crucial to the child's rehabilitation. The requirements for fulfilling this role are educational and developmental in nature, and should be pursued as a model for future patient care.</ABSTRACT>
