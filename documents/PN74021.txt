<TITLE>Bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis associated with inhalation of pancreatic extracts.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Five parents of children with cystic fibrosis developed allergic bronchospasm after inhaling pancreatic extracts sprinkled on their children's food. There was a positive history of allergy, but no past history of asthma in any of the 5 parents. Asthma responded to bronchodilators, and use of a face mask during preparation of meals prevented recurrences. To date, asthma precipitates by inhalation of pancreatic extracts has not been seen in any of the patients with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
