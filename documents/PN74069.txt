<TITLE>Hematological findings in Greek children with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>43 children with cystic fibrosis, of whom 16 had not received pancreatic extracts, were investigated hematologically. No difference was observed in mean hemoglobin and serum iron levels and bone marrow non hemoglobin iron between patients receiving and those not receiving pancreatic enzymes. A significant proportion of children in both groups were found to have mild iron deficiency. These findings are in agreement with the view that pancreatic insufficiency does not increase iron absorption.</ABSTRACT>
