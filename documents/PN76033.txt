<TITLE>Ventilatory disturbance in children with obstructive lung disease.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Disease in the small airways leads to alteration in the slope of phase III of the single breath nitrogen washout following a breath of 100% oxygen. Normal children and those with asthma and cystic fibrosis were studied by this technique. Measurement of the slope of phase III of the single breath washout appeared to be a sensitive indicator of abnormal pulmonary function in children with these diseases. Results obtained in many children with cystic fibrosis suggested that the upper lung regions were predominantly affected.</ABSTRACT>
