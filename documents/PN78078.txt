<TITLE>Spine deformities and cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Patients with cystic fibrosis have an increased risk for developing kyphosis and scoliosis. The risk for both kyphosis and scoliosis increases with age. The severity of kyphosis did not appear greater in the older age groups. Patients with retarded bone age may be more likely to have a significant spinal deformity. The presence of spine deformity does not correlate with the severity of pulmonary involvement, height, weight, serum protein and albumin in patients with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
