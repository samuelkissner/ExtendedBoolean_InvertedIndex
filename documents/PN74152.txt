<TITLE>The electron microscopic appearance of presecreted gastric mucus in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Gastric mucosal biopsies from eight new untreated patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and two normal subjects were studied by quantitative techniques of electron microscopy (EM) to determine whether presecreted gastric mucus was more compact (viscid) than normal. Analysis of variance techniques show no differences between means of all groups studied. These observations suggest that mucus may not be viscid prior to secretion. Electron microscopy of gastric mucus does not appear to be of diagnostic value in CF.</ABSTRACT>
