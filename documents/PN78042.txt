<TITLE>A controlled trial using intravenous infusion of soya oil emulsion in the treatment of children with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Five children with cystic fibrosis were given repeated intravenous infusions of soya oil emulsion (Intralipid) for 12 to 18 months and the effects on growth, health, sweat chloride and pancreatic enzyme activity compared with a control group. No beneficial effect was demonstrated and it is recommended that this form of therapy has no place in the routine treatment of children with cystic fibrosis. It is possible that treatment may have modified the degree of weight loss noted after 12 months of age. The lack of other beneficial effects and the problems involved in long-term Intralipid infusion should preclude the use of this form of therapy in the routine treatment of children with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
