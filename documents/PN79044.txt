<ABSTRACT>There has been a major change in the outlook for children with cystic fibrosis during the last 20 years. Provided the diagnosis is made before serious irreversible lung disease has occurred, most patients can expect to reach adult life without very serious disability.</ABSTRACT>
<TITLE>Inhibition of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein induction of alkaline phosphatase in cystic fibrosis fibroblasts by medium conditioned by normal cells.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>It is confirmed that the level of alkaline phosphatase in fibroblasts derived from cystic fibrosis patients can be induced many-fold by growing the cells in the presence of Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein. It is further shown that normal fibroblasts produce a "CF corrective factor" which markedly inhibits this phenomenon. These observations support a previous hypothesis on the nature of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
