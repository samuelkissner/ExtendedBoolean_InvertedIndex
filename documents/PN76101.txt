<TITLE>Oral health of patients with cystic fibrosis and their siblings.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Caries prevalence, oral hygiene index, submandibular gland hypertrophy, occlusion, dental hypoplasia, and staining of permanent teeth were evaluated in 63 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who were maintained on a regimen of broad-spectrum antibiotics and oral pancreatin, and the findings were compared with those of their near- aged siblings. Gland hypertrophy and dental staining were increased in patients with CF whereas caries was significantly decreased. No other significant differences were found.</ABSTRACT>
