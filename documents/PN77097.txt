<TITLE>Safety and antigenicity of inactivated influenza virus vaccines in children: trials with monovalent and bivalent A/New Jersey/76 (HswN1) and A/Victoria/75 virus vaccines in Washington, D.C.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Safety and antigenicity of monovalent and bivalent A/New Jersey/NJ)/76 (HssN1) and A/Victoria/75 inactivated influenza virus vaccines were studied in 125 children aged three to 18 years. In recruitment, families who knew the study team, who were professionally involved, and/or who were under close continuing care were more likely to volunteer for such studies than those who were unfamiliar with the team or institution. Antibody responses and systemic reactions occurred more often after administration of inactivated whole-virus vaccine than after split-virus vaccine. Significant titers (greater than or equal to 1:40) of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody to A/NJ/76 virus occurred in 95% of normal children three to 18 years of age who received two doses of the same vaccine (whole or split). However, insufficient numbers of children achieved a reasonable antibody titer (greater than or equal to 1:40) after one dose of vaccine.</ABSTRACT>
