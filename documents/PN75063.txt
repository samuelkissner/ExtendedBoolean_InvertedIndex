<TITLE>Immediate hypersensitivity in patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Twenty-three out of thirty patients with cystic fibrosis gave strong immediate skin hypersensitivity reaction to a wide variety of allergens. Seventy-five per cent of these had a markedly elevated serum IgE concentration whereas those patients who had negative Type 1 immediate skin reactions also had normal levels of serum IgE. The sputum of those patients with immediate skin reactivity also had positive precipitins to a variety of antigens.</ABSTRACT>
