<TITLE>Inhibitory effect of cystic fibrosis serum on pseudomonas phagocytosis by rabbit and human alveolar macrophages.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>This report presents experimental observations indicating the presence of an inhibitory activity in cystic fibrosis (CF) serum which impairs phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by rabbit as well as human alveolar macrophages. Of the 49 patient serum samples studied, 40 consistently showed greater than or equal to 60% inhibition, 3 showed no inhibition and 6 were in the range of 20-60% inhibition of Pseudomonas phagocytosis. In parallel studies, the phagocytosis of S. aureus and S. marcescens was found not to be inhibited by CF serum. Mixing of CF serum with normal serum could not overcome the inhibitory effect, indicating the presence of an inhibitory factor rather than the lack of a necessary component. The inhibitory activity is not lost upon exposure of serum to glass, upon freezing the serum once, or upon heating at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes.</ABSTRACT>
