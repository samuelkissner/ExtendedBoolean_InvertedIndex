<TITLE>Influence of lyophilized total pancreas on plasma lipids and on fat absorption in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>31 children with cystic fibrosis (CF) subdivided into three groups of age were studied before and after treatment with lyophilized pancreas and compared to 27 controls. CF was characterized by lower phospholipid, cholesterol and polyunsaturated fatty acid plasma concentrations and reduced coefficient of fat absorption. Treatment tended towards normalization of these values. With age polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in normals but not in CF. The significant correlations existing between fat absorption coefficient and polyunsaturated fatty acid percentage in neutral lipids of CF children suggests the use of the latter percentage as index of the stage of malabsorption.</ABSTRACT>
