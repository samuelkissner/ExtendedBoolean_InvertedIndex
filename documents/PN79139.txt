<TITLE>Meconium ileus: laparotomy without resection, anastomosis, or enterostomy.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>During the 14 yr from 1965 through 1978, 49 infants presented shortly after birth with intestinal obstruction due to impacted meconium. Three of these patients did not have fibrocystic disease. Eight patients were cured by a Gastrografin enema. There were 18 patients who had complications that included associated atresia, volvulus, and/or peritonitis. Various operations were done including resection with either primary anastomosis or enterostomy or varieties of the foregoing. Twenty-three babies had the simple uncomplicated form of meconium ileus. Eleven of these underwent resection and six patients died. Twelve patients were treated by laparotomy, ileotomy through a purse-string suture and prolonged irrigations using acetylcysteine. Of this group only one succumbed. This latter course of management is recommended for patients with simple uncomplicated meconium ileus as it involves no resection, no enterostomy, nor any primary anastomosis.</ABSTRACT>
