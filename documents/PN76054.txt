<TITLE>Cellular glycosaminoglycans in lymphocytes from patients with cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>Cellular glycosaminoglycans were isolated from lymphocytes from patients with cystic fibrosis and controls. The isolated glycosaminoglycans were fractionated by cellulose acetate electrophoresis, analyzed for glucosamine and galactosamine content, and subjected to hydrolysis with bovine testicular hyaluronidase. The total glycosaminoglycan content, the per cent glucosamine and galactosamine, and the distribution of cellular glycosaminoglycans in circulating lymphocytes in cystic fibrosis were no different from controls.</ABSTRACT>
