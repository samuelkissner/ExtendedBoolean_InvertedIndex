<TITLE>Deficiencies of essential fatty acids and vitamin E in cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>In 25 children (13 male; 12 female) with cystic fibrosis aged 6 months to 16 years and 24 matched controls total serum vitamin E levels and fatty acid patterns of serum cholesterol esters, phospholipids and triglycerides are demonstrated. Compared to controls (1.02 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) the total serum vitamin E levels are significantly decreased in patients with cystic fibrosis (0.30 +/- 0.26 mg/dl) (p less than 0.01). There is no significant difference comparing the fatty acid patterns of the serum ester fractions of both groups. Differences can be seen best in the cholesterol ester fraction. In this fraction linoleic acid shows a trend to be decreased in the cystic fibrosis patients compared to the control group. A possible influence of height velocity on the levels of essential fatty acids is discussed.</ABSTRACT>
