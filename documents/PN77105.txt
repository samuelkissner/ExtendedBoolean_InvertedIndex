<TITLE>The pharmacokinetics of amikacin in children.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>The pharmacokinetic variables of amikacin were measured in 20 children and adolescents, four to 16 years of age. The mean plasma clearance of amikacin was 120 ml/minute/1.73 m2. The major route of elimination was renal (82%). Simultaneously measured inulin clearance showed that a majority (64%) of the drug filtered by the kidneys was excreted in the urine. The mean volume of distribution of amikacin was 32% of body weight; half-life during the final (pseudoequilibrium) phase averaged 1.6 hours. No significant accumulation of the drug was seen when four doses were given intravenously at 420 mg/m2 every 8 hours; the plasma concentration just before injection of the fourth dose averaged 2.4 plus or minus 1.1 microgram/ml. The mean plasma concentration at 60 to 75 minutes after injection of the drug was 28.7 microg/ml with little interpatient variation (SD 3.5 microg/ml). When the dose was expressed in terms of milligrams per kilogram, it was found that children often needed 50 to 100% more of the drug, compared to adults, to achieve equivalent plasma concentrations; this larger requirement was primarily due to a higher clearance of amikacin in proportion to body weight. Dosages based on surface area, however, resulted in uniform requirements and predictable plasma concentrations in all patients studied.</ABSTRACT>
