<TITLE>Copper analysis of nail clippings. An attempt to differentiate between normal children and patients suffering from cystic fibrosis.</TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>From 39 normal children and 36 patients, suffering from cystic fibrosis (C/F), the copper content of finger nail clippings and toe nail clippings were determined. From this study it can be concluded that, although the patients with cystic fibrosis (C/F) have a higher copper content, the determination of copper in nail samples cannot be used in order to differentiate between normal children and patients. Also higher mean copper concentrations were found in finger nail clippings in comparison with toe nails. This difference was significant for patients with cystic fibrosis.</ABSTRACT>
